He says that he 's found the engines from the Apollo 11 space rocket - the craft that carried the first men to the moon in 1969 .	The five engines broke off from the spaceship after blast off and crashed somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean .	He 's now planning on trying to bring one of them to the surface .	Mr Bezos paid for a team to use advanced sonar scanning equipment to track down the lost F-1 engines .	They were found 4,300 metres below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean , but he has n't said exactly where they were spotted .	In a blog post about the discovery he wrote : `` I was five years old when I watched Apollo 11 unfold on television , and without any doubt it was a big contributor to my passions for science , engineering , and exploration . ''	He said he was going to ask Nasa , which owns the rockets , for permission to display one of the engines in the Museum of Flight in his home city of Seattle .
