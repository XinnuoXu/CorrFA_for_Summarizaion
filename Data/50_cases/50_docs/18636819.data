The astronauts , including China 's first woman in space , carried out a successful manual docking with the Tiangong-1 laboratory module .	The mission is a key step towards China 's goal of building a space station by 2020 .	Premier Wen Jiabao hailed the mission as a `` complete success '' .	By Jonathan AmosScience correspondent	The smiles said it all .	Jing Haipeng , commander of the Shenzhou-9 crew , was the first to emerge from the return capsule , followed by his flight engineers Liu Wang and the country 's first woman astronaut , Liu Yang .	The Shenzhou-9 mission posted a series of firsts : the first manned automatic and manual dockings ; the first long-duration spaceflight ; and the first crew to live aboard a permanently orbiting module , Tiangong-1 .	Beijing has long talked about its three-step strategy .	The first step was the development of the Shenzhou capsule system itself , the second involved the technologies needed for spacewalking and docking , and the third is China 's own space station .	But a word of caution .	Spaceflight , to quote the old cliche , is hard , and at some point the Chinese programme will encounter problems .	The history of spaceflight tells us unfortunately that some adversity is inevitable .	It will be interesting then to see how the Beijing authorities react .	Jonathan Amos ' full analysis	`` This is another outstanding contribution by the Chinese people to humanity 's efforts to explore and use space , '' Mr Wen said in Beijing .	`` It feels so good to stand on Earth , and it feels even better to be home , '' astronaut Liu Wang was quoted by national broadcaster CCTV as saying .	`` Tiangong-1 , our home in space , was comfortable and pleasant .	We 're very proud of our nation , '' female astronaut Liu Yang said .	The crew of the Shenzhou-9 craft successfully carried out the country 's manual docking manoeuvre earlier in the week .	The delicate procedure , which involved bringing together two orbiting vessels travelling at thousands of miles an hour , was mastered by the USSR and US space teams in the 1960s .	The crew also carried out automatic docking of the two crafts during their mission .	The three astronauts returned to the Shenzhou-9 spacecraft on Thursday and performed a manual separation from the space laboratory .	They touched down in Inner Mongolia 's Siziwang county , with the capsule deploying a parachute to slow its approach .	All the astronauts were in good health , state-run news agency Xinhua reported .	They were shown on CCTV leaving the capsule carried on chairs , smiling as they waved to supporters .	The crew included Jing Haipeng , 45 , the mission commander and a veteran astronaut , Liu Yang , 33 , and Liu Wang , 43 , who performed the manual docking .	Ms Liu , 33 , is a major in China 's air force from the central province of Henan .	On China 's Tencent QQ messaging service , she goes by the name `` little Flying Knight '' .	She was recruited into China 's space programme only two years ago , but she excelled , the official news agency Xinhua says .	The Shenzhou-9 spacecraft was launched on 16 June .
