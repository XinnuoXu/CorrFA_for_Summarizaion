Hearing partially improved when nerves in the ear , which pass sounds into the brain , were rebuilt in gerbils - a UK study in the journal Nature reports .	Getting the same improvement in people would be a shift from being unable to hear traffic to hearing a conversation .	However , treating humans is still a distant prospect .	If you want to listen to the radio or have a chat with a friend your ear has to convert sound waves in the air into electrical signals which the brain will understand .	This happens deep inside the inner ear where vibrations move tiny hairs and this movement creates an electrical signal .	However , in about one in 10 people with profound hearing loss , nerve cells which should pick up the signal are damaged .	It is like dropping the baton after the first leg of a relay race .	The aim of researchers at the University of Sheffield was to replace those baton-dropping nerve cells , called spiral ganglion neurons , with new ones .	While there is excitement at the prospect of using stem cells to restore nerves in the ear this exact technique will not help the vast , vast majority of people with hearing loss .	Most hearing problems are caused by damage to the tiny delicate hairs which convert mechanical vibrations into electricity .	This research group have also converted embryonic stem cells into the early versions of the hair cells .	However , injecting them into the ear to restore hearing will be no easy task .	The hairs cells all need to be in the exact place and pointing in exactly the right direction .	Prof Dave Moore said using stem cells to repair the hairs was `` almost an impossible task '' and that the far-fetched concept of growing and transplanting a replacement ear seemed more likely .	They used stem cells from a human embryo , which are capable of becoming any other type of cell in the human body from nerve to skin , muscle to kidney .	A chemical soup was added to the stem cells that converted them into cells similar to the spiral ganglion neurons .	These were then delicately injected into the inner ears of 18 deaf gerbils .	Over 10 weeks the gerbils ' hearing improved .	On average 45 % of their hearing range was restored by the end of the study .	Dr Marcelo Rivolta said : `` It would mean going from being so deaf that you would n't be able to hear a lorry or truck in the street to the point where you would be able to hear a conversation .	`` It is not a complete cure , they will not be able to hear a whisper , but they would certainly be able to maintain a conversation in a room . ''	About a third of the gerbils responded really well to treatment with some regaining up to 90 % of their hearing , while just under a third barely responded at all .	Gerbils were used as they are able to hear a similar range of sounds to people , unlike mice which hear higher-pitched sounds .	The researchers detected the improvement in hearing by measuring brainwaves .	The gerbils were also tested for only 10 weeks .	If this became a treatment in humans then the effect would need to be shown over a much longer term .	There are also questions around the safety and ethics of stem cell treatments which would need to be addressed .	Prof Dave Moore , the director of the Medical Research Council 's Institute of Hearing Research in Nottingham , told the BBC : `` It is a big moment , it really is a major development . ''	However , he cautioned that there will still be difficulties repeating the feat in people .	`` The biggest issue is actually getting into the part of the inner ear where they 'll do some good .	It 's extremely tiny and very difficult to get to and that will be a really formidable undertaking , '' he said .	Dr Ralph Holme , head of biomedical research for the charity Action on Hearing Loss , said : `` The research is tremendously encouraging and gives us real hope that it will be possible to fix the actual cause of some types of hearing loss in the future .	`` For the millions of people for whom hearing loss is eroding their quality of life , this ca n't come soon enough .
