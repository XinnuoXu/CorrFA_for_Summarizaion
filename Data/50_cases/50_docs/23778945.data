For girls , the figure was just 38 % , compared with 63 % for boys .	Half of the group also spent more than six hours being sedentary each day , although some of this would be spent in class , the researchers acknowledged .	The study , published in the online journal BMJ Open , found levels of activity varied among groups .	For example , children of Indian origin and those living in Northern Ireland were among the least physically active with 43 % achieving the recommended levels , compared to 53 % in Scotland .	But the most marked difference was between girls and boys .	Researchers said this suggested there needed to be a focus on making sport and other activities more attractive to girls .	Prof Carol Dezateux , one of the lead authors , said : `` There is a big yawning gap between girls and boys .	We need to really think about how we are reaching out to girls .	`` The school playground is an important starting point .	Often you will find it dominated by boys playing football . ''	But she said there should still be concern about the activity levels across the board .	`` The findings are particularly worrying because seven-year-olds are likely to become less active as they get older , not more . ''	To achieve the one hour recommendation children have to take part in moderate or vigorous activity , which includes everything from brisk walking and cycling to playing football and running .	The UCL research is not the first to suggest children are not active enough , but most previous studies have relied on self-reporting by children or parents estimating levels of exercise , whereas the latest one involved real-time monitoring .	During the study , which took place during 2008 and 2009 , youngsters wore an accelerometer to measure exercise levels which was attached to an elastic belt around their waist .	It was removed only when bathing or when the children went to bed .	In total , the experts were able to record more than 36,000 days of data based on the children wearing the accelerometer for at least 10 hours a day over the course of a week .	Dr John Middleton , of the Faculty of Public Health , said more research was needed into why certain groups were less active .	`` We need our children to grow up to be fit and healthy adults , not just because it 's what any civilised society would want for its children , but it 's also best for our economy too , '' he added .	Dr Ann Hoskins , of Public Health England , agreed .	She said : `` This study highlights that there is still much to do to keep children and young people active as they grow older , especially girls .	`` The new school year is the perfect time to make healthy changes , swapping short car or bus journeys with walking or scooting to school .
