Iain Duncan Smith said the raft of changes should save the taxpayer Â # 50bn by the end of this Parliament .	He said the reforms - including tougher criteria for people seeking disability allowances - would `` help and benefit '' those who wanted to return to work .	The Disabilities Trust charity said the reforms were part of a `` triple whammy '' of factors hitting disabled people .	Speaking on BBC One 's Andrew Marr Show , Mr Duncan Smith said : `` I think the work programme is now for the first time ever working with people , who were once on sickness benefits and who are now not , going back to work . ''	He said the new regime would see disabled benefits claimants assessed on a regular basis to determine whether they need more support with their ailments or help to get work .	`` There were over a million -LSB- people -RSB- not looked at for over 10 years , '' Mr Duncan Smith said .	`` These regular reviews , I think , will help them and benefit them .	We have n't introduced this to hurt or to harm disabled people .	The purpose is to try to support disabled people . ''	He added : `` The idea is to get people assessed so that we can find out those whose conditions have improved can then seek work , and many are going back to work now , and those who need full support get that full support . ''	The government has been gradually rolling out the new Personal Independence Payment -LRB- Pip -RRB- to replace the Disability Living Allowance -LRB- DLA -RRB- .	Under the old disability regime , claimants had to prove they could walk no further than 50m without support to receive the top end of the allowance .	Now , they will have to prove they can manage no more than 20m to benefit from the top payment .	Mr Duncan Smith insisted this was not a straight forward change , and that people would be assessed in two stages - on how much difficulty they have in reaching 20m first , and then 50m .	`` What we 're trying to do with these reforms is to get them to be fair so that the people who need them get better payments , and those who do n't need the higher levels do n't take the higher levels , '' Mr Duncan Smith said .	Under the DLA system , he said , 70 % of people who made a claim got awards `` for life '' .	The new regime will include regular face-to-face checks to establish the extent of claimants ' ailments .	He said the Department for Work and Pensions -LRB- DWP -RRB- expects almost half of the Â # 50bn in savings to come in the next 12 months .	The raft of welfare reforms , introduced a year ago , also included what the government calls the removal of the `` spare room subsidy '' but critics call the `` bedroom tax '' .	Mr Duncan Smith , defending it , said it was not a tax but rather a `` balanced and fair '' policy for taxpayers .	However , Sarah Clifford , director of communications for the Disabilities Trust , said the reforms were part of a `` triple whammy '' of factors affecting disabled people .	She said the changes needed to be seen alongside cutbacks by local authorities and changes to housing benefit in England , Scotland and Wales .	The housing benefits changes - dubbed the `` bedroom tax '' by critics but described by ministers as the removal of a `` spare room subsidy '' - were introduced in April last year .	A committee of MPs warned last week that the measures were creating `` financial hardship and distress '' for disabled people .	Ms Clifford said : `` We just hope Mr Duncan Smith can deliver on the promise that this will be a fair system and will not be unfair or unjust on people with disabilities . ''	Meanwhile , the work and pensions secretary said the government had sought to end a contract with the firm Atos , which was tasked with assessing whether benefit claimants were fit to work .	Mr Duncan Smith denied reports it was Atos that had ended the arrangement , saying the taxpayer would pay nothing for the early break in the contract .
