Scientists hope gene tests may help doctors one day to pinpoint individuals more likely to suffer these conditions .	But experts say lifestyle factors such as smoking and exercise have the greatest influence on risk .	Around one in 10 people in the Caucasian population carries this variation of the gene , named PIA2 .	And researchers from King 's College London reviewed more than 80 studies involving about 50,000 people - the largest analysis of this genetic fault to date .	They found individuals with PIA2 were more likely to have a stroke - caused by a blood clot blocking blood supply to the brain - than those without the gene .	Scientists calculate the gene increases a person 's risk of having a stroke by 10-15 % .	But how significant this increase is depends on an individual 's baseline risk - influenced by factors such as smoking , diet , weight and exercise , the scientists say .	And for people with two copies of the gene the risk rises by up to 70 % from this baseline .	In a second study published in the same journal , the scientists show PIA2 is also linked to an increased risk of heart attacks in people under 45 .	More research is needed to see whether this holds true for the whole population , they say .	About 150,000 people have a stroke in the UK each year and more than 100,000 heart attacks are recorded annually .	Both thrombotic strokes -LRB- the most common kind -RRB- and heart attacks are caused by blockage of blood vessels in the heart and brain - ultimately through the formation of clots .	The faulty gene appears to affect a protein called glycoprotein IIIa - present on platelets , natural clotting cells in the blood .	Platelets help trigger the formation of clots to stop bleeding after injury .	But scientists say carrying the gene may render them overactive .	They caution that overall the genes play a smaller role in risk than more established factors , such as high blood pressure and obesity .	But developing a genetic test could help predict people at highest risk , allowing doctors to suggest more potent medication or lifestyle changes , they say .	Prof Albert Ferro , of King 's College London , who led the research , told the BBC : `` We would now need to validate this test and see how useful it is in the clinical world . ''	Dr Shamim Quadir , of the Stroke Association , said : `` These latest results are an important step forward in stroke research .	`` We hope the findings from this study could lead to many more people who are most at risk of this devastating condition being identified .	`` However , if you have a family history of stroke or have any other risk factors , this does not mean the condition is inevitable .	Regular exercise , eating a balanced diet and stopping smoking can be important steps to significantly reduce your stroke risk . ''	Prof Jeremy Pearson , of the British Heart Foundation , said : `` It is as yet uncertain whether a genetic test to detect a variation in this protein would be beneficial for patients in everyday practice .	`` All patients who are at risk should be monitored to see whether or not lifestyle changes or medication have a positive impact on the more standard major risk factors such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol .
