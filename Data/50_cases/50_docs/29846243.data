Some fire brigades have warned the public could be left `` vulnerable '' and small fires may not be attended .	Fire Minister Penny Mordaunt said fire and rescue authorities have `` robust '' plans in place for the weekend .	Union officials say that under the government 's proposals firefighters will have to work until they are 60 instead of 55 , pay more into their pensions and get less in retirement .	The proposals will leave firefighters at risk of dismissal as their fitness declines into their 50s , the FBU said .	FBU members went on strike in England and Wales in August over the same dispute .	Strike action due to take place in Wales has been averted after a `` significant '' change of direction by the Welsh government , the FBU said .	General secretary Matt Wrack accused the Westminster government of `` sickening hypocrisy '' .	`` The real scandal is that their own pensions are by far the most generous anywhere in the public sector , '' he said .	One firefighter and his son carved pumpkins together and tweeted a photo in support of the strike .	`` It 's an issue which affects both me and my family and I have explained the dispute to him , '' said the firefighter , who asked not to be named .	The West Yorkshire brigade said the public would be left in a `` vulnerable position '' and asked people to take extra care this weekend .	The London brigade said it may not attend rubbish or small grass fires or help anyone stuck in a lift .	Industrial action over the past 18 months has seen fire authorities spend millions hiring contractors to cover for striking FBU members .	The FBU said it expected about 36,000 firefighters to walk out .	The fire minister said : `` All fire and rescue authorities have robust and well-tested plans in place that include back-up support if needed .	`` Public safety is the primary focus and if anyone needs emergency assistance , they should dial 999 . ''	She said strike action was `` unnecessary '' after pension regulations laid in parliament on Tuesday mean nearly three quarters of firefighters will see no change in their pension age in 2015 .
