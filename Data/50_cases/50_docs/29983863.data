`` Stalled , '' she said , before challenging anyone in the room to name a significant change that had taken place in the last two years .	So is she right ?	Has the much vaunted Burmese reform project ground to a halt ?	The answer depends on how narrowly you define reform .	When she speaks , Ms Suu Kyi is thinking politics .	The pace of political change has certainly slowed .	In part that 's because the easiest reforms took place in the first 18 months of Thein Sein 's presidency .	In the Burmese context , `` easy '' means decisions that do n't upset the army .	Political prisoners were released , censorship of newspapers and the internet lifted and a -LRB- flawed -RRB- law passed allowing public demonstrations .	In a short period of time , one of the world 's most tightly controlled societies opened up in a way few had thought possible .	Stories critical of ministers were suddenly on the front page of private newspapers , and demonstrations , mostly connected to land rights , have become almost daily events .	But the early pace of those changes has n't been sustained .	There was no way it could .	So did the reformers run out of steam ?	Did Thein Sein 's project reach a roadblock manned by hardliners in the Burmese army ?	Or perhaps we 're close to the final destination - that is , with sanctions lifted and the army still really in charge .	Ms Suu Kyi 's main frustration is that the constitution remains unchanged .	Drafted in 2008 , it entrenches the military 's control of political life , guaranteeing it a quarter of the seats in the Hluttaw -LRB- the Burmese parliament -RRB- , and a veto over any changes to the constitution .	This is what its architects proudly call a `` disciplined democracy '' .	The opposition have focused on the two parts they want changed most .	They are : the clause barring anyone who has foreign family members from becoming president , which effectively prevents Ms Suu Kyi from taking power -LRB- because of her British sons -RRB- and Article 436 , which gives the army a veto on constitutional changes .	Much of Ms Suu Kyi 's annoyance stems from the fact that the legislature that she joined in 2012 , and thus legitimised , is now being cynically used to thwart her ambition .	Just as it would in mature democracies , responsibility for shaping the constitutional reform process was handed to a series of parliamentary committees .	With each committee mirroring the composition of the military-dominated Hluttaw , they 've deliberated for months and delivered entirely predictable results .	Altering the `` Suu Kyi clause '' has been dismissed outright -LRB- as a threat to national sovereignty -RRB- , while amending Article 436 will be discussed in parliament , though if the army remains opposed there 's no way it can be changed .	Ms Suu Kyi 's slim hopes of taking the top job after the election in 2015 now rest on a backroom deal among senior leaders .	Looming in many minds is the possibility of a constitutional crisis this time next year .	What if the party that wins the most seats is unable or unwilling to nominate a president ?	Though the changes that Aung San Suu Kyi wants most have stalled , that 's not to say there have n't been other important developments .	It 's just that they do n't directly involve Ms Suu Kyi .	Ever since independence in 1948 , Myanmar has never been truly at peace , with minority ethnic groups fighting guerrilla wars against the Burman-dominated state .	The last three years has seen real progress towards what would be an unprecedented nationwide ceasefire agreement .	All the major rebel groups have been brought into the process , attracted by the promise of dialogue on a more federal future .	For President Thein Sein , a peace agreement would be the crowning achievement of what 's likely to be his only term in office .	Unfortunately for him , with a deal within reach , the number of clashes has begun to increase once more .	Outside politics , particularly in the big cities , people 's lives are changing fast .	Thanks to new laws and regulations , Myanmar 's economy and banking sectors are liberalising and opening up to the outside world .	GDP growth is rapid , though improvements in living standards still lag a long way behind .	On Myanmar 's streets two new foreign phone companies are currently battling it out for a lucrative new market .	After years in which mobile phones and the internet were government-run and SIM cards the preserve of the elite , there 's now the prospect of low-cost data and unrestricted access to information .	In itself that 's a game-changer .	So is the Myanmar reform glass half full or half empty ?	It rather depends who you are , and what you 're drinking .
