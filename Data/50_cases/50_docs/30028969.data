The Fire Department of New York earlier told the BBC the two people were uninjured and tethered .	The call came in at 12:42 EST -LRB- 17:42 GMT -RRB- and firefighters were on the scene in less than four minutes , it said .	The window cleaners were pulled inside at around 14:15 EST. .	The rescued men were identified as Juan Lopez , who has been a window cleaner for five years , and Juan Lizama , who has been on the job for 14 years , Gerard McEneaney , a labour union official , told Reuters .	The 1,776 ft -LRB- 541m -RRB- tower opened for business last week as the first of 3,000 employees of publishing giant Conde Nast moved into their new offices there .	A police official said the partially collapsed cradle was hanging at `` a 75-degree angle '' .	The cable on the cradle apparently broke as it retracted towards the roof of the building .	People on the ground were moved back in case glass fell from One World Trade Center , the country 's tallest skyscraper .	Gary Hansen , an architect who worked on the building , happened to be across the street during the incident .	Mr Hansen told Reuters the building was designed with three cranes on top , two to suspend platforms and one for emergencies .	`` These are the kind of emergencies architects plan for , '' he said .
