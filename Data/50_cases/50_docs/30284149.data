The band 's set at Seaclose Park will be their only festival show of the year .	The set on Sunday 14 June , which will close the festival , will include original member Christine McVie , who recently confirmed that she would be rejoining the band .	Festival organiser John Giddings told Newsbeat : `` It 's the best news I 've had in a long while . ''	He said that he had been asking the band to perform at the Isle of Wight for the last seven years .	`` Every year I have asked without fail , '' he revealed .	`` I 'd like to tell you otherwise but it 's true , I have begged them . ''	Previous acts to headline Isle of Wight Festival include The Who , the Rolling Stones and Paul McCartney .	Despite his years of asking the band to perform , John Giddings explained that he thought Fleetwood Mac , whose debut album Peter Green 's Fleetwood Mac went to number four in the UK in 1968 , did n't need much persuading .	He said : `` If you 're a band of substance , it -LSB- Isle of Wight -RSB- becomes part of your bucket list really . ''	Red Hot Chili Peppers , Kings of Leon and Biffy Clyro headlined the event this year .	Talking about choosing the rest of the 2015 line-up , John Giddings said : `` The problem is when you 're looking for some of the top acts in the world , there are n't that many of that calibre ... without repeating yourself it becomes harder by the year . ''	However , the organiser did say there would be some newer acts named on the line-up .	`` When we announce Friday and Saturday , you will see younger bands .	It 's an eclectic mix of past , present and future bands . ''	The organiser added that the other two headline acts of the festival would be announced soon .	Giddings agreed younger bands have the ability to sell festival tickets as well as older bands like Fleetwood Mac and Lionel Ritchie , who has been named as the first act on the Glastonbury 2015 line-up .	He said : `` I think younger bands of course can do it as well , but the golden age of rock and roll is past .	`` The music is different now whereby you can download individual songs on iTunes and it becomes hard to name the lead singer of Bastille or Imagine Dragons . ''	He said `` there are lots of groups out there '' but added `` who is the biggest act out of England that have toured stadiums in the last five years ?	One Direction .	`` I think they 'd rather be somewhere else than at the Isle of Wight festival . ''	However , John Giddings did say `` there are great new bands out there '' and referred to The Black Keys and Royal Blood as `` incredible '' .	The Isle of Wight organiser was recently quoted as calling Ed Sheeran `` boring '' having suggested `` we 're -LRB- the UK -RRB- not building headliners any more '' .	He told Newsbeat that `` he 's jolly good fun '' and after saying he 'd recently met the 23-year-old added : `` He 's selling tickets and he 's selling records and we should all be grateful for his existence . ''	Tickets go on sale on Friday at 09:00 GMT	Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube
