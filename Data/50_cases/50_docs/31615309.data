The shadow attorney general has written to the Australian Federal Police -LRB- AFP -RRB- seeking an immediate investigation .	The HRC released a report condemning the treatment of children in detention .	Their report said that detaining children of asylum seekers violated international human rights law , and called for their release .	Speaking to journalists in Sydney on Wednesday , Mr Abbott repeated his earlier statements that the government had lost confidence in Ms Triggs as president of the HRC .	`` What she does is a matter for her , '' said Mr Abbott in response to a question about whether she should resign .	`` As the secretary of the Attorney General 's Department has made clear , she was not asked to resign and no inducement has been offered . ''	On Tuesday , Australia 's Prime Minister Tony Abbott launched a scathing attack on the HRC report , saying that it was a `` political stitch-up '' .	Earlier in a senate hearing , Ms Triggs said that she had been asked to resign during a meeting on 3 February by the secretary of Attorney General George Brandis ' department .	`` I rejected it out of hand , '' she said , as quoted by ABC News .	Ms Triggs told the hearing that the department 's secretary , Chris Moraitis , had said that she would be offered another job with the government .	She added that she had been `` very shaken and shocked '' by the `` disgraceful proposal '' and had reminded Mr Moraitis that she had a five-year statutory position .	In a letter to the AFP commissioner , Shadow Attorney General Mark Dreyfus said : `` The attorney general 's offer to an independent statutory officer of an inducement to resign her position as president , with the object of affecting the leadership of the -LSB- HRC -RSB- to avoid political damage to the Abbott government may constitute corrupt and unlawful conduct . ''	ABC News reported that Mr Dreyfus said that Ms Triggs preferred not to use the term `` inducement '' but that she had made it clear that the resignation request and the offer of a job had been connected .	Local media reported that Mr Moraitis has denied asking Ms Triggs to resign but said they had discussed the possibility of her taking on another role .	The attorney general admitted to the senate committee that he had lost confidence in Ms Triggs because of the timing of the inquiry into detained children , according to local media .	He added that `` as a matter of goodwill '' he had told Mr Moraitis that he hoped that she could be encouraged to serve the government in other capacities .	The HRC report , entitled The Forgotten Children , was published earlier in February .	It said a third of detained children had developed mental illnesses of such severity that they required psychiatric treatment .	The number of children in detention has fallen under Mr Abbott 's government .	He has questioned why the HRC did not launch an inquiry when the Labor government was in power and there were almost 2,000 children in detention centres .	Successive Australian governments have been criticised over their harsh asylum policies , under which asylum seekers are detained for long periods in offshore camps while their applications are processed .
