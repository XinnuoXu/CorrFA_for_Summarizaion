The French government proposed senior diplomat Laurent Stefanini for the post in January but the Vatican is yet to respond to approve the choice .	The Vatican usually responds within six weeks to approve such a new ambassador .	The nomination of Mr Stefanini was seen as a litmus test for Pope Francis , who has taken a more liberal stance on homosexuality .	A French government spokesman said there had been negotiations with the Vatican over the appointment .	`` France has chosen its ambassador to the Vatican .	This choice was Stefanini and that remains the French proposal , '' said spokesman Stephane Le Foll .	Observers say most Vatican appointments are confirmed within six weeks and that this long silence should be read as a rejection .	The Vatican traditionally makes no statement if it intends to decline a nomination .	Mr Stefanini served in the Holy See as a deputy ambassador in the French embassy from 2001 to 2005 .	He was described by the country 's foreign ministry as `` one of our best diplomats '' .	France legalised same-sex marriage in 2013 , despite opposition from the Catholic Church .	Pope Francis is regarded as more tolerant of homosexuality than previous popes .	`` Who am I to judge ? ''	, he said in 2013 .
