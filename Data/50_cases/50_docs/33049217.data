The local authority has awarded the sum to Hearthstone Investments , a London property fund which hopes to build 1,000 new homes across the country .	The Falkirk Local Government Pension Scheme Fund contribution could pay for up to 300 new homes , including 126 in Falkirk and Clackmannanshire .	Social Justice secretary Alex Neil said the fund was `` a trailblazer '' .	Hearthstone aims to raise # 150m for its Housing Fund For Scotland , including contributions from the country 's 11 local government pension schemes .	It plans to provide funds to local housing associations to invest directly in social housing , as well as buying affordable homes to be let at a mid-market rent .	Edinburgh-based housing association Castle Rock Edinvar will manage the initial building programme for social rent houses .	Mr Neil said : `` The # 30m Falkirk Local Government Pension Scheme fund investment will , I believe , act as a trailblazer and encourage other Scottish local authority pension fund trustees to take the plunge and invest in housing .	`` For an acceptable risk profile , investment will provide pension funds good , long-term returns for their members and a social investment to help build stronger communities .
