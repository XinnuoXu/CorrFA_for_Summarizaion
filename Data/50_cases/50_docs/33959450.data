Rural Affairs Secretary Richard Lochhead announced the move earlier this month .	Almost 30 organisations have signed an open letter seeking an urgent meeting with him to discuss their concerns .	Mr Lochhead said the changes would not affect research .	Under EU rules , GM crops must be formally authorised before they can be cultivated .	An amendment came into force earlier this year , allowing member states and devolved administrations to restrict or ban the cultivation of genetically modified organisms within their territory .	Mr Lochhead announced he would use the amendment to request Scotland be excluded from European consents for the cultivation of GM crops .	The letter - whose signatories include the National Farmers ' Union , the Royal Society of Edinburgh , the Roslin Institute and the European Academies Science Advisory Council - said they were `` extremely concerned '' about the `` negative impact '' a ban could have .	It claimed the decision was `` political and not based on any informed scientific assessment of risk '' .	The scientists and academics said outlawing the cultivation of GM crops `` risks constraining Scotland 's contribution to research and leaving Scotland without access to agricultural innovations which are making farming more sustainable elsewhere in the world . ''	The letter cited examples where `` a GM method has a contribution to make '' .	It highlighted ongoing research on things which `` might benefit Scotland 's farmers , consumers and environment '' including potatoes that can reduce fungicide use and omega-3 enriched oilseeds that may offer a more sustainable source of feed for salmon farming .	Responding to the letter , Mr Lochhead said he respected the views of those in the scientific community and would be happy to meet them .	He said he would `` reassure them that these changes will not affect research as it is currently carried out in Scotland , where the contained use of GM plants is permitted for scientific purposes , such as in laboratories or sealed glasshouse facilities '' .	He added : `` However , just because GM crops can be cultivated in Scotland it does n't mean they should be .	`` Scotland 's Ã‚ # 14bn food sector has a reputation for a clean and green image across the world and allowing the cultivation of GM crops could damage that unique selling point . ''	Last week , a former chief science adviser to the Scottish government warned on ban on GM crops could have `` apocalyptic '' consequences and threaten the country 's food and drinks industry .	Prof Muffy Calder , who stepped down from the role in December and has yet to be replaced , said she was `` disappointed and angry '' and called on ministers to publish the scientific basis for their decision .	Professor Neva Haites , vice president for life sciences at The Royal Society of Edinburgh , told BBC Scotland : `` Most governments try to get the best advice possible before they make these decisions .	`` In the past we have had chief scientific advisers such as Dame Anne Glover and Prof Calder , who were there to give advice on such subjects .	`` We no longer have such an adviser in government at the moment and the scientific body that usually gives advice has not met for some time .	`` So we are suggesting it is time they actually looked again and sought some very senior advice on this subject .
