Carlos Ghosn , Renault 's chairman and chief executive officer , also hinted the company 's relationship with Red Bull is likely to end this year .	Ghosn said : `` We have already alerted the F1 authorities and told them : ` Do n't count on us as a provider of an engine - it 's over . ' ''	Renault is in the process of trying to negotiate a takeover of the cash-strapped Lotus team .	But Ghosn said there was still a possibility the company could walk away from F1 .	`` Our future is the subject of detailed analysis and renegotiating , '' he said .	`` We will either exit or run our own team .	We do n't have a clear decision yet . ''	Renault has an engine supply contract with Red Bull until 2016 .	But Red Bull are doing `` necessary due diligence '' in talking to other engine suppliers , with the team expected to use Ferrari power next year after failing to come to an agreement with Mercedes .	Ghosn said Renault would `` honour our contracts '' but admitted the company was renegotiating `` so it 's too early to say what 's going to be the conclusion '' .	Ghosn said Red Bull 's treatment of Renault during the previous six years had been instrumental in the company 's decision .	The pairing won four consecutive drivers ' and constructors ' world titles from 2010-13 , but Red Bull have been heavily critical of Renault in public since the start of 2014 .	The Austrian team accuse the French manufacturer of failing to build a competitive version of the new turbo hybrid engines that F1 adopted last year .	`` Unfortunately when we were winning championships the Renault name was never mentioned .	It was the team that was winning , '' he said .	`` So we started to feel the return on this investment was very weak .	`` It was intensified by the fact that when the technology changed and we moved from the V8 engine to the present technology , some of the teams using our engine did not fare well , and the reasons for which they are not performing became the engine .	`` So you are in the game that when you perform very well you are never mentioned , and when there is a problem with the team you are the first guy to be pointed at . ''	Ghosn said it was not a question of whether the criticism was `` fair or unfair '' .	He added : `` It 's a sport .	You ca n't just say ' I lost , but my team-mate was really ... '	`` I think it 's a question of sportsmanship .	We are expecting , that when we are in a sport working with other people , we win together and we lose together . ''
