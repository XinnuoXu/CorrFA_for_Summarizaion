The Richmond Park and North Kingston MP said he was `` honoured '' after winning 70 % of the 9,227 votes cast using an online primary system .	He beat London Assembly Member Andrew Boff , MEP Syed Kamall and London 's deputy mayor for crime and policing Stephen Greenhalgh .	Mr Goldsmith 's main rival is likely to be Labour 's Sadiq Khan .	Mr Khan beat former cabinet minister Tessa Jowell and a number of other current MPs to win the Labour nomination last month .	Caroline Pidgeon is the Lib Dem candidate , Sian Berry will contest the election for the Greens and UKIP has chosen its culture spokesman Peter Whittle .	Former Respect MP George Galloway is also running .	Mr Goldsmith , who was the favourite for the Tory nomination , balloted his constituents earlier this year to seek permission to stand .	At the very point of his entry into the race for London mayor , Zac Goldsmith 's decision revealed two big characteristics .	Only a politician with an acute sense of accountability would have sought permission to stand through a ballot of his constituency members in Richmond and North Kingston .	Only someone with his personal wealth would have been able to afford the estimated Â # 60,000 cost of doing it .	Both characteristics could come to feature heavily in the months to come .

Syed Kamall came second with 1,477 votes ahead of Stephen Greenhalgh -LRB- 864 -RRB- and Andrew Boff -LRB- 372 -RRB- .	Mr Goldsmith - who first entered Parliament in 2010 - told the BBC 's Daily Politics that he hoped his environmental record would appeal to Green and Lib Dem voters and he also hoped to `` reach out '' to UKIP supporters frustrated with politics as usual and the UK 's relationship with the EU .	Mr Goldsmith , who has confirmed he would stand down from Parliament if he became mayor , triggering a by-election , said he wanted to build on current mayor Boris Johnson 's achievements .	But he said anyone who attempted to replicate Mr Johnson 's style of leadership would be `` deluded '' as he was a `` unique figure '' in British politics .	`` If people are in the market for a ` Boris mark two ' are going to be very disappointed , '' he said , adding that people wanted someone who `` will bend George Osborne 's ear and get a good deal for London '' .	He also told the BBC News Channel that high-polluting vehicles should be `` phased out '' of the capital 's streets and that his biggest priority would be housing .	Both Mr Khan and Mr Goldsmith oppose a new runway at Heathrow airport , a fact described by the British Chambers of Commerce as `` depressing '' .	Mr Goldsmith is also promising more transport investment to prevent London `` grinding to a halt '' and to `` protect , enhance and improve access '' to green spaces .	Current mayor Boris Johnson will step down next year after two terms in office .	He is also currently the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip , having been returned to Parliament in May .	Some Conservatives have called for an inquiry into the mayoral election process after only 9,227 people voted - compared with a 87,884 turnout for the Labour contest .	In an attempt to open up the contest to people who were n't Conservative members , anyone on the electoral roll was able register to vote for Â # 1 .	But one of the campaign teams told the BBC earlier this month the process `` looked chaotic '' .	Speaking on the BBC 's Daily Politics , Mr Galloway dismissed Mr Goldsmith as a `` Great Gatsby figure '' who could not relate to most Londoners ' lives and Mr Khan as `` a very boring man '' .	He revealed policies including compulsorily purchasing any house left vacant for more than a year and having 50 % of all homes in the capital as social housing .
