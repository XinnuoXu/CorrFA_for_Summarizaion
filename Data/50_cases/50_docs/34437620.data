The 68-year-old Dutchman was appointed in March , when the Black Cats were one point above the relegation zone .	He guided them to safety and was due to leave the club in the summer , only to sign a new one-year contract .	Advocaat said : `` I have made the decision to go after only eight games as I felt it was important to give everyone time to turn things around . ''	Sunderland chairman Ellis Short said : `` I am truly saddened by Dick 's decision , but I respect him for his honesty .

''	Assistant head coach Zeljko Petrovic has also left the club .	Saturday 's draw with West Ham left Sunderland without a win in their first eight league matches and looking for a sixth manager in four years .	Since Steve Bruce was sacked in November 2011 , Martin O'Neill , Paolo di Canio , Gus Poyet and Advocaat have managed the club .	Advocaat 's departure also follows a trend set by Di Canio and Poyet of managers arriving to save the Black Cats from the drop , only to depart in the next season .	He initially agreed to lead Sunderland only until the end of last season , shedding tears as their survival was secured with a 0-0 draw at Arsenal .	Advocaat said he would leave the club to fulfil a promise to his wife , but changed his mind and returned in June .	The former Netherlands , Russia and South Korea boss has seen his side win just once this season - against League Two Exeter in the League Cup .	North-east rivals Newcastle are the only team below them in the Premier League table .
