While it limits recruitment from outside the EU , it has `` stimulated recruitment '' from EU countries , the home affairs select committee said .	Net migration rose by 30 % in the year to June , to 336,000 - more than three times David Cameron 's intended target .	The PM has said he will not abandon his aim to reduce the figure to 100,000 .	Under the immigration cap , introduced in 2011 , the number of `` tier 2 '' visas issued to skilled workers from non-EU countries is limited to 20,700 a year .	But a report by the select committee concluded the limit had been `` counter-productive '' .	It added that `` a large number '' of applications from nurses with job offers in the UK were being rejected because of limits on the number of visas issued each month .	Committee chairman Keith Vaz said the government 's immigration cap was having `` no effect '' on bringing down net migration - the difference between those coming into the country and those going out each year - but `` could have caused a crisis in the NHS this winter '' .	He said : `` When the cap was reached earlier this year , we saw the perverse effects of the system , as the cap prioritises higher-paid jobs .	`` In June , nurses were being prevented from working in the UK , which necessitated the government taking emergency measures to allow recruitment to continue .	`` Whilst this was a very welcome move , it is clear to see that the system could have caused a crisis in the NHS this winter .	`` A system which encourages panicked adjustments to be functional is not fit for purpose .	Nurses should remain on the shortage occupation list . ''	A total of 641,000 people moved to the UK in 2014 , the Office for National Statistics said .
