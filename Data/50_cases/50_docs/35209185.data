The copyright has now expired and Munich 's Institute of Contemporary History is to publish a new edition .	New versions are expected in many countries .	Historians say the book helps academics understand what happened in the Nazi era .	Its annotated version , with thousands of academic notes , will aim to show that Mein Kampf -LRB- My Struggle -RRB- is incoherent and badly written , rather than powerful or seductive .	Many Jewish groups have welcomed this particular publication , saying it is important to have access to a critical edition to help explain the Holocaust , reports the BBC 's Damien McGuinness in Berlin .	Mein Kampf was originally printed in 1925 - eight years before Hitler came to power .	After Nazi Germany was defeated in 1945 , the Allied forces handed the copyright to the book to the state of Bavaria .	The local authorities have refused to allow the book to be reprinted to prevent incitement of hatred , although the book was so widely printed during the war that it remained relatively easily available .	Under European copyright law , the rights of an author of a literary or artistic work runs for the life of the author and for 70 years after his death - in Hitler 's case on 30 April 1945 , when he shot himself in his bunker in Berlin .	Those rights cease on the first day of January 70 years after the author 's death , and so publishers now have free access to the original text .	However , German officials have said they will limit public access to the text amid fears that this could stir neo-Nazi sentiment .
