West Berkshire Council is setting up an emotional health academy to train psychology graduates and health professionals .	The local authority said , once trained , its staff will work with children , families and schools .	It wants to greatly reduce the wait mental health patients face from 12 months to less than a week .	The council also hopes the new academy will stop problems escalating to the stage where they require attention from more highly trained mental health specialists .	Director of Children 's Services Rachael Wardell said : `` It works better if you get in there sooner , when people are waiting for help their condition gets worse .	`` There are lots more things you can do early on without needing to go to a very high-level with a psychologist or psychiatrist .	`` It is a way of bridging the gap . ''	Plans were submitted to the Department of Health in October and the council hopes to launch the academy in April while contributing about Â # 120,000 a year , with local schools matching its total .	Local NHS commissioning groups could also contribute Â # 100,000 a year and local businesses are being asked to help out financially as well .
