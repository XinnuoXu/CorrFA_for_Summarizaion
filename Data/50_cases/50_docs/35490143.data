One of those held was being sought by Algerian authorities , and they may have been planning an attack in Germany , police said .	The New Year unrest in Cologne fuelled German unease about a huge influx of asylum seekers .	Two men - a Tunisian and a Moroccan - have been charged over the Cologne offences .
