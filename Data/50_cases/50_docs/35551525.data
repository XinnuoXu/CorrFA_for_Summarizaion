The ex-Middlesbrough assistant , who held the same post at Hartlepool under Colin Cooper from 2013 to 2014 , succeeded Ronnie Moore on Wednesday .	Moore parted company with Pools after Tuesday 's 2-1 home defeat by Stevenage .	`` The quality I 've seen in training , the intensity and the tempo took me by surprise a bit , '' Hignett told BBC Tees .	`` I 'm walking into a positive situation .	Results and performances have n't been the same , the group of players I 've seen today are more than capable of beating teams in this league . ''	Former Tranmere and Rotherham boss Moore helped retain Hartlepool 's Football League status last term after his appointment in December 2014 .	However despite a run of four straight wins at the start of the campaign , form tailed off and Hignett will go into Saturday 's home game against Yeovil looking for a first win in five with his side four points above the relegation zone .	`` First and foremost we need to get away from where we are , '' he added .	`` I need to get my message across to the team quickly because there will be a change in style . ''	Liverpudlian Hignett is a self-confessed relaxed and jovial character , but says that will have no impact on his performance with reference to Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp .	`` Tell Jurgen Klopp that -LSB- you have to be serious -RSB- , there 's a time to be serious and a time where you do n't have to be , '' he added .	`` I do like a laugh and a joke , but when I 'm serious I 'm serious , there 's a time and a place .	`` Training we have to be serious , match-day ultra serious , but after the game - win lose or draw - I 'll be me .	`` If I want to have a laugh and joke afterwards , as long as the result is n't too bad then I will . ''	Since Hignett 's last stint on the Pools ' touchline , the club has been taken over by JPNG - led by chairman Gary Coxall - from Ken Hodcroft and IOR Limited .	`` I was really impressed by what he -LSB- Coxall -RSB- had to say , '' Hignett added .	`` What he wants to do with the club in the future , how he wants to grow the club , his vision , he wanted a clear identity for it - everything I 'd want to bring to a football club .	`` For me it was the perfect fit .
