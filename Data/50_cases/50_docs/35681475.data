It is calling for faster broadband access for homes and business .	A government spokesperson said most UK homes can get `` superfast '' broadband .	`` Almost nine out of ten UK properties has access to superfast speeds and 95 % of the UK will be reached by 2017 , '' a spokesperson for the Department for Culture , Media and Sport told the BBC .	But the IoD believes the target should be higher and is calling for speeds of 10 gigabits per second -LRB- Gbps -RRB- by 2030 , 1,000 times faster than the current official aim of 10 megabits per second -LRB- Mbps -RRB- by 2020 .	`` Now is the time to set a bold new target for genuinely world-beating broadband , '' said Dan Lewis , senior advisor on Infrastructure Policy at the IoD , and author of the report .	`` We have the leading internet economy in the G20 , and yet download speeds are mediocre and the coverage of fibre optic cable is woeful . ''	He added : `` Unfortunately , the Government 's current target displays a distinct poverty of ambition . ''	Mr Lewis said the government needed to look at how the UK could provide the physical infrastructure needed to maintain a position `` at the forefront of digital innovation in business '' .	IoD members interviewed for the report said that better broadband speeds could increase their company 's productivity , make them more competitive , and enable them to offer more flexible working to their staff .	The IoD report comes just days after communications watchdog Ofcom said BT must open up its cable network and allow competition to improve UK internet connections .	Ofcom also said there was a digital divide in the UK between those with the latest technologies , and those without .	It has proposed that decent , affordable broadband should be a universal right .	Rivals had called for a split between BT and its Openreach operation , which runs its cables , fibre and network infrastructure .	Companies such as Sky , Vodafone and TalkTalk , who pay to use the network , had claimed that BT underinvested in Openreach , leading to a poor service with interruptions and slow speeds .
