A 24-hour walkout by members of the Rail , Maritime and Transport -LRB- RMT -RRB- union , in protest at the introduction of driver-only trains , ended at 11:00 BST on Wednesday .	Southern warned passengers to expect `` difficult and frustrating '' journeys throughout the day .	Two further strikes have been announced for 10 May and 12 May .	Latest updates here	The RMT confirmed it would attend talks with Southern `` over the guards jobs and safety dispute '' on Friday .	Dyan Crowther , chief operating officer for Southern owner Govia Thameslink Railway , told BBC Sussex : `` We are very pleased to hear that and we look forward to meeting the RMT '' .	Southern said some routes were again suspended or reduced with 700 fewer services across Sussex and east Surrey .	Ms Crowther said the timetable would not return to normal until Thursday as they needed to get rolling stock and staff into the right position .	Paul Barker , a commuter from Rye , normally catches a Southern train to Ashford then a high-speed service to St Pancras .	He said he worked from home on Tuesday but went to Robertsbridge on Wednesday to catch a Southeastern service to London .	He said : `` It was standing room only from Frant , but you can not take two days off work '' .	RMT general secretary Mick Cash said : `` This dispute is about safety .	The company , with an eye on ever-fatter profits , is prepared to axe the guards on some of the most overcrowded and potentially-dangerous services . ''	The company said there would be no job or pay cuts but the planned changes would make conductors more visible while drivers would operate doors .	It accused the RMT of `` scaremongering '' and said `` driver-only operation is a safe , proven way of working '' which had been used `` on 40 % of trains across the Southern network for 25 years '' .
