Amina Ali Nkeki , 19 , was found with a baby by an army-backed vigilante group on Tuesday in the huge Sambisa Forest , close to the border with Cameroon .	She was one of 219 pupils missing since they were abducted from a secondary school in eastern Chibok in April 2014 .	They were taken by the Islamist militant group Boko Haram .	Amina was reportedly recognised by a civilian fighter of the Civilian Joint Task Force -LRB- JTF -RRB- , a vigilante group set up to help fight Boko Haram .	She was with a suspected Boko Haram fighter who is now in the Nigerian military 's custody .	Named as Mohammed Hayatu , he said he was Amina 's husband .	Aboku Gaji , leader of the JTF in Chibok :	`` The moment this girl was discovered by our vigilantes , she was brought to my house .	I instantly recognised her , and insisted we should take her to her parents .	`` When we arrived at the house ... I asked the mother to come and identify someone .	The moment she saw her , she shouted her name : ` Amina , Amina ! '	She gave her the biggest hug ever , as if they were going to roll on the ground , we had to stabilise them .	`` The mother called the attention of other relations to come out and see what is happening .	The girl started comforting the mother , saying : ` Please Mum , take it easy , relax .	I never thought I would ever see you again , wipe your tears .	God has made it possible for us to see each other again . '	`` Afterwards , we had to make them understand that the girl would not be left in their care .	She must be handed over to the authority . ''	Interview with BBC Hausa service	Amina and her baby have been taken to taken to the regional capital Maiduguri for medical attention , the military said .	A spokesman for Nigeria 's President Muhammadu Buhari said the rescued young woman would be brought to meet the head of state , before being helped to reintegrate into society .	Chibok rescue revives Twitter campaign	Inside Mbalala , the town that lost its girls	Chibok abductions : What we know	Hosea Abana Tsambido , the chairman of the Chibok community in the capital , Abuja , told the BBC that Amina had been found after venturing into the forest to search for firewood .	`` She was sayingâ $ ¦ all the Chibok girls are still there in the Sambisa except six of them that have already died . ''	By Will Ross , BBC News	Amina was found by a local vigilante group out on a routine patrol .	These groups , which have played a vital role in the fight against Boko Haram , sprang up in 2013 in the main city of north-east Nigeria , Maiduguri .	It was a desperate measure at a terrible time when the jihadists were winning the war , seizing territory whilst reports of soldiers fleeing rather than fighting were common .	More vigilante groups then sprang up across the north-east and , with local knowledge of the terrain , they had some success stopping their homes from being taken over - even though they were armed with just rudimentary weapons .	As the Nigerian military started getting its act together at the beginning of 2015 , with help from outside , it started retaking territory and in some areas worked effectively with the vigilantes .	There is , however , great concern that as peace returns the vigilantes - who have tasted power - pose a danger themselves .	During the April 2014 attack , Boko Haram gunmen arrived in Chibok late at night , then raided the school dormitories and loaded 276 girls on to trucks .	More than 50 managed to escape within hours , mostly by jumping off the lorries and running off into roadside bushes .	A video broadcast by CNN in April this year appeared to show some of the kidnapped schoolgirls alive .	Fifteen girls in black robes were pictured .	They said they were being treated well but wanted to be with their families .	The video was allegedly shot on Christmas Day 2015 and some of the girls were identified by their parents .	The Chibok schoolgirls , many of whom are Christian , had previously not been seen since May 2014 , when Boko Haram released a video of about 130 of them gathered together reciting the Koran .	The abduction led to the #BringBackOurGirls campaign , which was supported by US First Lady Michelle Obama and Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai .	` Boko Haram took my children '	Town divided by Boko Haram legacy	On patrol against Boko Haram	Who are Boko Haram ?
