Mansfield voted most strongly to leave , with 70.9 % backing Brexit .	Rushcliffe , which includes the towns of West Bridgford and Bingham , was the only area to vote for Remain .	It saw the East Midland 's highest turnout .	Meanwhile , the turnout in Nottingham was the fifth lowest in the UK at 61.8 % .	Leave won by a tiny margin of just over 2,000 votes in the city .	Mr Mann said his party was `` somewhat out of touch '' .	`` With the middle classes largely voting remain because they see it as benefiting them and the working classes largely voting to leave because it dis-benefits them - that 's the divide in Britain , '' he said .	Latest reaction and updates from Nottinghamshire	Like large parts of England , Nottinghamshire overwhelmingly voted to leave the European Union .	The margin of victory in Bassetlaw , Ashfield and Mansfield was huge , with less than a third of people voting remain .	Arguably the biggest surprise came in Nottingham , which narrowly backed Brexit .	Affluent Rushcliffe was the only area to vote Remain .	Overall Nottinghamshire voted 57.9 % for Leave and 42.1 % for Remain .	Conservative Anna Soubry , the MP for Broxtowe and a Remain campaigner , tweeted it was `` a dreadful decision '' .	`` People like me were told you 're scaremongering , we do n't want to listen to the experts , '' she said .	`` All that has been unfortunately proved to be accurate .	We have made a very , very , very bad mistake . ''	Labour MP for Nottingham North , Graham Allen , said David Cameron had `` gambled with Britain 's future '' by calling for a referendum , saying people voted to leave `` in protest '' at the current government .	Turnout was 81.5 % in Rushcliffe - the highest in the East Midlands and the only council area to vote Remain .	The vote was close elsewhere , including in Nottingham , where the split was 50.8 % Leave , 49.2 % Remain .	Alice , a caller to BBC Radio Nottingham from the Carrington area of the city , said she felt `` frightened of the future '' .	`` It potentially gives a mandate for a lot of prejudice against people who have immigrated here , whether from the EU or elsewhere , '' she said .
