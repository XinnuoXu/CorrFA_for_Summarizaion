She said economic growth and a stronger jobs market meant `` the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened in recent months '' .	There has been a growing expectation that US interest rates will rise this year .	Some economists are saying that the next hike could even come next month .	The central bank raised interest rates at the end of last year for the first time in nearly a decade , but has held them steady amid concerns over persistently low inflation .	Ms Yellen , speaking at a three-day symposium in Jackson Hole , Wyoming , did not comment on when rates would rise .	But she said `` the US economy was nearing the Federal Reserve 's statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability '' .	She added : `` In light of the continued solid performance of the labour market and our outlook for economic activity and inflation , I believe the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened in recent months . ''	However , Ms Yellen emphasised that future rate increases should be `` gradual '' .	She noted that inflation is still running below the Fed 's 2 % target , but said this is being depressed mainly by temporary factors .	Subadra Rajappa , head of rates strategy at Societe Generale , in Washington , said : `` We were n't really expecting her to signal a hike at the September meeting , but she 's just kept the door open for a hike sooner rather than later .	`` I think that the Fed wants to get the market to start pricing in a hike for this year , which they were n't doing earlier , and now I 'm seeing the probability of a hike by December has gone up slightly over a coin toss . ''	John Canally , economist at Boston-based LPL Financial , added : `` It looks like she is warming a little more to a hike this year , probably not September but probably December . ''	Signs of slow improvements in the US economy came in data published on Friday .	Although the growth rate of second quarter GDP was revised down slightly , from an annual rate of 1.2 % to 1.1 % , consumer spending - which makes up more than two-thirds of US economic activity - was revised up from 4.2 % to 4.4 % .	Separately , US Labor Department figures showed that claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 261,000 for the week ended 20 August .	It was the third straight weekly decline in claims .	On Tuesday , Commerce Department data showed that US new homes sales jumped in July to their fastest rate in nearly nine years .	Ms Yellen 's remarks helped lift US share markets in early trading .	On the currency markets , the dollar was flat against the euro at $ 1.1286 and slightly lower against the yen at 100.28 yen .
