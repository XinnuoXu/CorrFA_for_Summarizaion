They are planning to stage a protest on Friday night .	However , a community advert placed in the Irish News said the protest would not help ease tensions .	Among the signatories are politicians , academics and sporting organisations as well as the Catholic Bishop of Down and Connor , Noel Treanor , and the Church of Ireland Bishop of Connor , Alan Abernethy .	It stated : `` We believe this is the best opportunity we have had in 15 years to resolve an issue , which has divided our community for many years .	`` It is our view the introduction of another evening parade , no matter what part of the community it comes from , would inevitably and regrettably , whether intentional or otherwise raise tensions , damage community relations , and has the potential to end in confrontation and undermine a long sought after resolution . ''	The agreement to which Garc is opposed was announced last week between the Orange Order and the Crumlin Ardoyne Residents Association -LRB- Cara -RRB- .	The group is billing its protest as a `` march and rally to oppose ongoing sectarian parades and SF/UVF deal -LRB- Sinn FÃ © in/Ulster Volunteer Force -RRB- . ''	The SDLP has not added its name to the advert .	However , in a statement SDLP North Belfast MLA Nichola Mallon said : `` There are genuine frustrations and fears in this community as the weekend approaches .	`` However , it is also important that people express their views and feelings in a responsible manner .	`` Our advice to Garc is to reconsider their planned parade this Friday , to take a step back and act in the interests of peace in our community . ''	The Parades Commission has granted permission for Garc to hold their parade on Friday evening subject to a number of conditions - including directing it away from `` part of the notified route between Ardoyne Road or Crumlin Road '' .	Permission has also been granted for Garc to hold a protest parade on Saturday morning .	Garc spokesperson Damien ` Dee ' Fennell attended the launch of dissident republican party Saoradh on Saturday 24 September , and Garc has been consistently highly critical of Sinn FÃ © in .
