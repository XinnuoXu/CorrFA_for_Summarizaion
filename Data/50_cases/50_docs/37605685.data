The pair will receive 8 million Swedish krona -LRB- Ã‚ # 744,652 -RRB- from the committee .	Mr Hart , who was woken with the news at 4.40 am , said his first reaction had been to hug his wife and wake his younger son .	Mr Holmstrom said he felt `` very lucky '' and `` grateful '' .	The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said that Mr Hart and Mr Holmstrom 's work was `` valuable to the understanding of real-life contracts and institutions '' .	It also said it could identify `` potential pitfalls in contract design . ''	Working separately , the two created tools to help determine whether public sector workers should receive fixed salaries or performance-based pay , and whether providers of public services should be publicly or privately owned .	Mr Holmstrom in particular is known for his research into how contracts and incentives affect corporate behaviour .	The former Nokia board member declined to say whether he thought executive pay was too high these days , but commented : `` My personal view is that -LSB- top executives ' contracts -RSB- are too complicated today . ''	Mr Holmstrom , aged 67 , is a professor of economics and management at Massachusetts Institute of Technology , while Mr Hart , born in 1948 , is an economics professor at Harvard University in the US .	The pair saw off competition from the World Bank 's new chief economist Paul Romer , who was widely tipped to win .	New York University 's Stern Business School , where Prof Romer teaches , sparked controversy last Thursday when it accidently published a press release naming him as the winner .	It quickly took down the release , saying it was only preparing for a possible win .	Others believed to be the running included Olivier Blanchard , a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund , and Edward Lazear , a fellow at the Hoover Institution , Stanford University .	The economics prize is the only Nobel not created by Alfred Nobel , and was instead launched in 1968 , long after the philanthropist 's death .	To date Americans have dominated the award , with 55 of the 76 laureates holding US citizenship , including those with dual nationalities .	Last year Scottish-born economist Angus Deaton won the prize for his use of data to investigate income inequality and inform economic policy .	It is the fifth Nobel to be announced this year , after prizes for physiology or medicine , physics , chemistry and peace were awarded last week .	The Nobel prize for literature will be awarded on Thursday .
