The ministerial response shows 5 % of council schools have budget deficits .	Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said funding gaps had become a `` national scandal '' .	`` Over 1,000 schools are in the red .	This should be worrying to every parent , '' said Mr Farron .	His party had asked ministers how many schools and academy trusts , which run chains of schools , were in debt .	There have been growing warnings from schools about problems with funding .	The heads of every state school in West Sussex recently sent a letter to Downing Street , warning that they would have to consider cutting school hours or making teachers redundant if they did not receive emergency funding .	They warned that schools faced a `` dire financial position '' .	In a debate this week on school funding in West Sussex , MPs backed their concerns .	Sir Nicholas Soames , Conservative MP for Mid-Sussex , said funding arrangements were `` unsatisfactory and unfair '' and budget shortages would have a `` damaging effect '' on schools .	Tim Loughton , Conservative MP for East Worthing , said there was `` nothing left in the tank '' for many schools and that head teachers were telling him that school finances were at `` breaking point '' .	Head teachers say that budgets have not kept up with rising costs .	There are also particular regional shortfalls , with the government postponing plans to introduce a national funding formula aimed at addressing local anomalies in funding levels .	Education Minister Nick Gibb 's reply to the question on schools in debt showed that in 2014-15 there were 113 academy trusts with a revenue deficit , representing 4 % of trusts .	There were 944 local authority schools in deficit , representing 5.3 % of such schools .	The National Association of Head Teachers said problems with school funding were `` very serious '' .	A spokesman said a survey showed that two-thirds of schools were `` dipping into reserves to stave off deficits '' - and there were fears that rising costs would make this worse .	`` I worry that in order for schools to bring their budgets in line to repay their debt , they will have to look at cutting staff , which makes up for 80 % of the school expenditure , '' said Mr Farron .	`` There will be less extracurricular activities , IT equipment or even books as cash is funnelled into clearing the debt . ''	Kevin Courtney , general secretary of the National Union of Teachers , called on the government to provide `` immediate additional funding '' .	`` School budgets are being cut to the bone , and many more could find themselves in debt as the funding crisis worsens .	`` We estimate that 92 % of schools in England could face real terms budget cuts over the next four years . ''	But Department for Education spokeswoman said : `` All academy trusts must balance their budget from each academic financial year to the next .	`` We continue to monitor the tiny number of trusts which reported a deficit at the end of the academic year 2014-15 .
