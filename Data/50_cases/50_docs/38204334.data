On the first anniversary of Storm Desmond , experts say November to January were the wettest three months since UK records began in 1910 .	Review author Terry Marsh said flooding was `` extensive and repetitive '' .	Storm Desmond began battering parts of the UK on 5 December , depositing a record month 's worth of rain on Cumbria in just one day .	About 5,200 homes were flooded in Cumbria and Lancashire , while tens of thousands more lost power after an electricity sub-station in Lancaster was flooded .	The storm caused an estimated insurance bill of more than Ã‚ # 1.3 bn .	Major storms `` Abigail '' , `` Frank '' and `` Gertrude '' also hit the UK last winter .	A study by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology -LRB- CEH -RRB- , in collaboration with the British Hydrological Society , found many rivers across northern England , Scotland and Northern Ireland saw record peak flows during the three-month period .	It found the rivers Eden , Tyne and Lune in England saw record peaks of around 1,700 cubic metres per second .	Experts say such levels could fill London 's Royal Albert Hall in less than a minute .	Although last winter 's floods were more extreme in scale , flooding in 1947 had a greater impact in terms of homes flooded and crops destroyed , the appraisal found .	However , lead author Terry Marsh from CEH said the national scale of last winter 's floods were `` the most extreme on record '' .	`` The associated flooding was both extensive and repetitive , and total river outflows from Great Britain following the passage of Storm Desmond in December exceeded the previous maximum by a substantial margin , '' he said .
