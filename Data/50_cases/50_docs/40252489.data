The findings were published on Tuesday by Statistics Canada .	The annual report by the federal statistics agency was compiled using police data from across the country .	Nearly half of all incidents were linked to race or ethnicity , with black Canadians the most common target .	Just over a third of reported hate crimes were motivated by hatred of a religion .	Canada 's Jewish population remained the most targeted religious group , accounting for 13 % of all incidents , despite a decline in the overall number of reported crimes .	Shimon Koffler Fogel , with the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs , called the data `` disturbing and clear '' .	He also said in the statement that the Jewish community stood with other targeted groups in condemning hatred in all its forms .	`` An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us , '' he said .	Muslims reported being more frequently targeted in 2015 , with 159 incidents reported compared with 99 in 2014 , accounting for 12 % of all incidents .	However , Statistics Canada notes many police services have reached out to ethnic communities and there have been efforts by groups like the National Council of Canadian Muslims -LRB- NCCM -RRB- to encourage reporting .	Incidents targeting Catholics also increased , jumping from 35 to 55 individual incidents .	Almost 40 % of all reported hate crimes were considered violent incidents , which could include assault and uttering threats .	Members of the LGBT community reported slightly fewer hate crimes in 2015 but were more likely to be the victims of hate-related violence .	In a news conference following the report 's release , the NCCM 's legal counsel , Khalid Elgazzar , pointed to the murder of six men in a Quebec City mosque this January as `` a painful reminder of how hate can destroy lives and deeply shake communities '' .	The NCCM was joined by other groups in calling for more funding and resources for police forces to fight hate crimes and improve reporting .	The Statistics Canada report notes that the figures do not paint a full picture of the true extent of hate crime in Canada .	They suggest that only about 35 % of hate crimes are actually reported to police .
