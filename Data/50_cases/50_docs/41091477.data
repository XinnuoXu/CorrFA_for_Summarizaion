The Duchess of Cambridge joined the princes on the garden tour .	A spokeswoman for Kensington Palace said : `` The engagement will allow the princes to pay tribute to the life and work of their mother . ''	They met representatives from the causes and charities supported by Diana , including the Royal Marsden and Great Ormond Street hospitals , the National Aids Trust , Centrepoint youth homelessness charity and the Leprosy Mission .	Members of the public have been leaving tributes and flowers at the gates of the palace to mark the anniversary of Diana 's death .	The Princess of Wales died on 31 August 1997 in Paris , when William , now the Duke of Cambridge , was 15 and his brother was 12 .	The garden at their mother 's former home has been inspired by memories of her life , style and image , such as her white `` Elvis '' Catherine Walker dress .	The White Garden , as it is known , follows a tradition first established at Sissinghurst Castle in Kent , famous for its own white garden created in the 1930s .	Their Royal Highnesses met gardener Sean Harkin who designed the display and Graham Dillamore who knew the princess when he worked there some 30 years ago .	The garden has been open since spring and will continue into September with white roses , lilies , gladioli and cosmos .	It is the fourth London memorial created in tribute to Diana - the others are the Diana Memorial Playground at Kensington Palace , the Diana Memorial Fountain in Hyde Park , and the Diana Memorial Walk at St James 's Palace .
