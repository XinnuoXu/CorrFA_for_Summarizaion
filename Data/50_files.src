He says that he 's found the engines from the Apollo 11 space rocket - the craft that carried the first men to the moon in 1969 .	The five engines broke off from the spaceship after blast off and crashed somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean .	He 's now planning on trying to bring one of them to the surface .	Mr Bezos paid for a team to use advanced sonar scanning equipment to track down the lost F-1 engines .	They were found 4,300 metres below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean , but he has n't said exactly where they were spotted .	In a blog post about the discovery he wrote : `` I was five years old when I watched Apollo 11 unfold on television , and without any doubt it was a big contributor to my passions for science , engineering , and exploration . ''	He said he was going to ask Nasa , which owns the rockets , for permission to display one of the engines in the Museum of Flight in his home city of Seattle .
Prof Les Mayhew said the difference between the sexes peaked at nearly six years in the 1970s .	Life expectancy is going up all round , but the rates for men are increasing faster .	Plummeting smoking rates in men are thought to explain a lot of the change .	Prof Mayhew , a professor of statistics at Cass Business School , analysed life expectancy data in England and Wales .	He was working out how long 30-year-olds could expect to live .	His findings show men languishing far behind for decades , but now starting to get closer to women .	If current trends continue , Prof Mayhew predicts , both sexes could , on average , be living to the age of 87 in 2030 .	He said : `` What 's interesting at the moment is that in the last 20 years or so , male life expectancy at 30 has jumped by about six years and if it jumps by the same amount in the next 20 years it will converge with female life expectancy . ''	The reason could be down to men living a healthier lifestyle .	`` One of the main reasons , I think , is the trend in the prevalence of smoking .	Smoking took off after 1920 in the male population and at its high about 80 % of males smoked .	`` This was reflected in more divergence in the life expectancy , so by the time you get to about 1970 it was at its peak - the difference in life expectancy was about 5.7 years . ''	Other factors are thought to be safer , more office-based , jobs .	Millions of men used to work in hazardous occupations such as coal mining .	Healthcare has meant more men live longer as well .	People with heart disease , which is more common in men , can expect to live much longer than they did a few decades ago .	By contrast , women started smoking later than men .	, but are falling fast in men .	A boy and a girl born on the same day will still not have the same life expectancies , as the study looked only at people who had already reached 30 .	Boys are more likely to die in their first year of life and are more likely to take up dangerous sports or be involved in fatal accidents .	It means that women could still have the edge for some time to come .	Prof David Leon , from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , said : `` In virtually all countries in the world , women do have a slight advantage . ''	However , he said the gap was definitely closing in some countries .	Countries with lower levels of life expectancy , such as in sub-Saharan Africa , showed very little difference between the genders .	This was due to the prevalence of infectious diseases which `` are not picky about men and women '' , he said .	In countries that had defeated most infectious diseases , such as in Eastern Europe , `` there is a much bigger difference , mostly dominated by lifestyle factors '' .	At one point in the 1990s , the gap between life expectancies in Russia reached 13 years .	Prof Leon said it was an `` absolutely massive '' difference in a `` very gendered society '' .	In his third class of countries , such as the UK , the gap in life expectancies is starting to narrow .	He said : `` Men are getting a bit better behaved and women are adopting male life expectancies . ''

The astronauts , including China 's first woman in space , carried out a successful manual docking with the Tiangong-1 laboratory module .	The mission is a key step towards China 's goal of building a space station by 2020 .	Premier Wen Jiabao hailed the mission as a `` complete success '' .	By Jonathan AmosScience correspondent	The smiles said it all .	Jing Haipeng , commander of the Shenzhou-9 crew , was the first to emerge from the return capsule , followed by his flight engineers Liu Wang and the country 's first woman astronaut , Liu Yang .	The Shenzhou-9 mission posted a series of firsts : the first manned automatic and manual dockings ; the first long-duration spaceflight ; and the first crew to live aboard a permanently orbiting module , Tiangong-1 .	Beijing has long talked about its three-step strategy .	The first step was the development of the Shenzhou capsule system itself , the second involved the technologies needed for spacewalking and docking , and the third is China 's own space station .	But a word of caution .	Spaceflight , to quote the old cliche , is hard , and at some point the Chinese programme will encounter problems .	The history of spaceflight tells us unfortunately that some adversity is inevitable .	It will be interesting then to see how the Beijing authorities react .	Jonathan Amos ' full analysis	`` This is another outstanding contribution by the Chinese people to humanity 's efforts to explore and use space , '' Mr Wen said in Beijing .	`` It feels so good to stand on Earth , and it feels even better to be home , '' astronaut Liu Wang was quoted by national broadcaster CCTV as saying .	`` Tiangong-1 , our home in space , was comfortable and pleasant .	We 're very proud of our nation , '' female astronaut Liu Yang said .	The crew of the Shenzhou-9 craft successfully carried out the country 's manual docking manoeuvre earlier in the week .	The delicate procedure , which involved bringing together two orbiting vessels travelling at thousands of miles an hour , was mastered by the USSR and US space teams in the 1960s .	The crew also carried out automatic docking of the two crafts during their mission .	The three astronauts returned to the Shenzhou-9 spacecraft on Thursday and performed a manual separation from the space laboratory .	They touched down in Inner Mongolia 's Siziwang county , with the capsule deploying a parachute to slow its approach .	All the astronauts were in good health , state-run news agency Xinhua reported .	They were shown on CCTV leaving the capsule carried on chairs , smiling as they waved to supporters .	The crew included Jing Haipeng , 45 , the mission commander and a veteran astronaut , Liu Yang , 33 , and Liu Wang , 43 , who performed the manual docking .	Ms Liu , 33 , is a major in China 's air force from the central province of Henan .	On China 's Tencent QQ messaging service , she goes by the name `` little Flying Knight '' .	She was recruited into China 's space programme only two years ago , but she excelled , the official news agency Xinhua says .	The Shenzhou-9 spacecraft was launched on 16 June .
Hearing partially improved when nerves in the ear , which pass sounds into the brain , were rebuilt in gerbils - a UK study in the journal Nature reports .	Getting the same improvement in people would be a shift from being unable to hear traffic to hearing a conversation .	However , treating humans is still a distant prospect .	If you want to listen to the radio or have a chat with a friend your ear has to convert sound waves in the air into electrical signals which the brain will understand .	This happens deep inside the inner ear where vibrations move tiny hairs and this movement creates an electrical signal .	However , in about one in 10 people with profound hearing loss , nerve cells which should pick up the signal are damaged .	It is like dropping the baton after the first leg of a relay race .	The aim of researchers at the University of Sheffield was to replace those baton-dropping nerve cells , called spiral ganglion neurons , with new ones .	While there is excitement at the prospect of using stem cells to restore nerves in the ear this exact technique will not help the vast , vast majority of people with hearing loss .	Most hearing problems are caused by damage to the tiny delicate hairs which convert mechanical vibrations into electricity .	This research group have also converted embryonic stem cells into the early versions of the hair cells .	However , injecting them into the ear to restore hearing will be no easy task .	The hairs cells all need to be in the exact place and pointing in exactly the right direction .	Prof Dave Moore said using stem cells to repair the hairs was `` almost an impossible task '' and that the far-fetched concept of growing and transplanting a replacement ear seemed more likely .	They used stem cells from a human embryo , which are capable of becoming any other type of cell in the human body from nerve to skin , muscle to kidney .	A chemical soup was added to the stem cells that converted them into cells similar to the spiral ganglion neurons .	These were then delicately injected into the inner ears of 18 deaf gerbils .	Over 10 weeks the gerbils ' hearing improved .	On average 45 % of their hearing range was restored by the end of the study .	Dr Marcelo Rivolta said : `` It would mean going from being so deaf that you would n't be able to hear a lorry or truck in the street to the point where you would be able to hear a conversation .	`` It is not a complete cure , they will not be able to hear a whisper , but they would certainly be able to maintain a conversation in a room . ''	About a third of the gerbils responded really well to treatment with some regaining up to 90 % of their hearing , while just under a third barely responded at all .	Gerbils were used as they are able to hear a similar range of sounds to people , unlike mice which hear higher-pitched sounds .	The researchers detected the improvement in hearing by measuring brainwaves .	The gerbils were also tested for only 10 weeks .	If this became a treatment in humans then the effect would need to be shown over a much longer term .	There are also questions around the safety and ethics of stem cell treatments which would need to be addressed .	Prof Dave Moore , the director of the Medical Research Council 's Institute of Hearing Research in Nottingham , told the BBC : `` It is a big moment , it really is a major development . ''	However , he cautioned that there will still be difficulties repeating the feat in people .	`` The biggest issue is actually getting into the part of the inner ear where they 'll do some good .	It 's extremely tiny and very difficult to get to and that will be a really formidable undertaking , '' he said .	Dr Ralph Holme , head of biomedical research for the charity Action on Hearing Loss , said : `` The research is tremendously encouraging and gives us real hope that it will be possible to fix the actual cause of some types of hearing loss in the future .	`` For the millions of people for whom hearing loss is eroding their quality of life , this ca n't come soon enough .

''	Media playback is not supported on this device	The Polish driver is competing this year in the European Rally Championship for Citroen and is doing work for the Mercedes F1 team in their simulator as he continues his recovery .	He says he is still some way from being able to compete in F1 because of the restricted movement of his arm and fingers .	`` I have suffered big injuries in the rally crash , '' the 28-year-old said , `` but I am still lucky I am able to drive on a high level , although not any more in F1 .	`` Driving F1 would not be such a big problem , the problem would be to drive a complete race in all circuits but unfortunately that is not possible for now .	`` The problem in F1 is the space .	Maybe one day if the FIA say the car has to be 10-15 cm wider , I can drive - but it is not that rally is second choice .	`` What is important for me is I am seeing progress .	Even if in normal life I struggle with using the hand , -LSB- but -RSB- driving I see the progress , in the rally car , in the simulator .	`` The question is how far I will go and how long it will take but to be honest it really does n't matter if it will take one month , one year or 10 years , maybe one day I will have chance to drive F1 again . ''	Kubica , who won the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix for BMW Sauber and finished eighth in the world championship in his maiden season with Renault in 2010 , was considered one of the very best drivers in the sport at the time of his crash .	He admitted the past two years had been difficult for him to handle .	But asked whether he was still in love with motorsport , he said : `` I think more .	I was always thinking I was very lucky to be in F1 .	`` I spent a hard time after the accident for many months - I would say maybe even for nearly two years - not just because of the surgeries , the recovery and the pain but afterwards because when you recover you lie down in the hospital , you start missing it and then you realise how much maybe not love but affection you have for the sport . ''	He added : `` I paid quite a big price for a mistake but I could have paid a much higher price , that 's for sure .	`` It is unfortunately part of this sport that you have to accept .	If you are driving you are not thinking about this .	If you do n't accept , you do n't do it . ''	Kubica made it clear he still prioritised success in F1 over rallying but said he would not try to rush his recovery .	He said : `` What I learned is that because of my situation I can not look too much forward .	I have to look week after week , day after day and move forward , that 's the most important .

For girls , the figure was just 38 % , compared with 63 % for boys .	Half of the group also spent more than six hours being sedentary each day , although some of this would be spent in class , the researchers acknowledged .	The study , published in the online journal BMJ Open , found levels of activity varied among groups .	For example , children of Indian origin and those living in Northern Ireland were among the least physically active with 43 % achieving the recommended levels , compared to 53 % in Scotland .	But the most marked difference was between girls and boys .	Researchers said this suggested there needed to be a focus on making sport and other activities more attractive to girls .	Prof Carol Dezateux , one of the lead authors , said : `` There is a big yawning gap between girls and boys .	We need to really think about how we are reaching out to girls .	`` The school playground is an important starting point .	Often you will find it dominated by boys playing football . ''	But she said there should still be concern about the activity levels across the board .	`` The findings are particularly worrying because seven-year-olds are likely to become less active as they get older , not more . ''	To achieve the one hour recommendation children have to take part in moderate or vigorous activity , which includes everything from brisk walking and cycling to playing football and running .	The UCL research is not the first to suggest children are not active enough , but most previous studies have relied on self-reporting by children or parents estimating levels of exercise , whereas the latest one involved real-time monitoring .	During the study , which took place during 2008 and 2009 , youngsters wore an accelerometer to measure exercise levels which was attached to an elastic belt around their waist .	It was removed only when bathing or when the children went to bed .	In total , the experts were able to record more than 36,000 days of data based on the children wearing the accelerometer for at least 10 hours a day over the course of a week .	Dr John Middleton , of the Faculty of Public Health , said more research was needed into why certain groups were less active .	`` We need our children to grow up to be fit and healthy adults , not just because it 's what any civilised society would want for its children , but it 's also best for our economy too , '' he added .	Dr Ann Hoskins , of Public Health England , agreed .	She said : `` This study highlights that there is still much to do to keep children and young people active as they grow older , especially girls .	`` The new school year is the perfect time to make healthy changes , swapping short car or bus journeys with walking or scooting to school . ''
Iain Duncan Smith said the raft of changes should save the taxpayer Â # 50bn by the end of this Parliament .	He said the reforms - including tougher criteria for people seeking disability allowances - would `` help and benefit '' those who wanted to return to work .	The Disabilities Trust charity said the reforms were part of a `` triple whammy '' of factors hitting disabled people .	Speaking on BBC One 's Andrew Marr Show , Mr Duncan Smith said : `` I think the work programme is now for the first time ever working with people , who were once on sickness benefits and who are now not , going back to work . ''	He said the new regime would see disabled benefits claimants assessed on a regular basis to determine whether they need more support with their ailments or help to get work .	`` There were over a million -LSB- people -RSB- not looked at for over 10 years , '' Mr Duncan Smith said .	`` These regular reviews , I think , will help them and benefit them .	We have n't introduced this to hurt or to harm disabled people .	The purpose is to try to support disabled people . ''	He added : `` The idea is to get people assessed so that we can find out those whose conditions have improved can then seek work , and many are going back to work now , and those who need full support get that full support . ''	The government has been gradually rolling out the new Personal Independence Payment -LRB- Pip -RRB- to replace the Disability Living Allowance -LRB- DLA -RRB- .	Under the old disability regime , claimants had to prove they could walk no further than 50m without support to receive the top end of the allowance .	Now , they will have to prove they can manage no more than 20m to benefit from the top payment .	Mr Duncan Smith insisted this was not a straight forward change , and that people would be assessed in two stages - on how much difficulty they have in reaching 20m first , and then 50m .	`` What we 're trying to do with these reforms is to get them to be fair so that the people who need them get better payments , and those who do n't need the higher levels do n't take the higher levels , '' Mr Duncan Smith said .	Under the DLA system , he said , 70 % of people who made a claim got awards `` for life '' .	The new regime will include regular face-to-face checks to establish the extent of claimants ' ailments .	He said the Department for Work and Pensions -LRB- DWP -RRB- expects almost half of the Â # 50bn in savings to come in the next 12 months .	The raft of welfare reforms , introduced a year ago , also included what the government calls the removal of the `` spare room subsidy '' but critics call the `` bedroom tax '' .	Mr Duncan Smith , defending it , said it was not a tax but rather a `` balanced and fair '' policy for taxpayers .	However , Sarah Clifford , director of communications for the Disabilities Trust , said the reforms were part of a `` triple whammy '' of factors affecting disabled people .	She said the changes needed to be seen alongside cutbacks by local authorities and changes to housing benefit in England , Scotland and Wales .	The housing benefits changes - dubbed the `` bedroom tax '' by critics but described by ministers as the removal of a `` spare room subsidy '' - were introduced in April last year .	A committee of MPs warned last week that the measures were creating `` financial hardship and distress '' for disabled people .	Ms Clifford said : `` We just hope Mr Duncan Smith can deliver on the promise that this will be a fair system and will not be unfair or unjust on people with disabilities . ''	Meanwhile , the work and pensions secretary said the government had sought to end a contract with the firm Atos , which was tasked with assessing whether benefit claimants were fit to work .	Mr Duncan Smith denied reports it was Atos that had ended the arrangement , saying the taxpayer would pay nothing for the early break in the contract .

Scientists hope gene tests may help doctors one day to pinpoint individuals more likely to suffer these conditions .	But experts say lifestyle factors such as smoking and exercise have the greatest influence on risk .	Around one in 10 people in the Caucasian population carries this variation of the gene , named PIA2 .	And researchers from King 's College London reviewed more than 80 studies involving about 50,000 people - the largest analysis of this genetic fault to date .	They found individuals with PIA2 were more likely to have a stroke - caused by a blood clot blocking blood supply to the brain - than those without the gene .	Scientists calculate the gene increases a person 's risk of having a stroke by 10-15 % .	But how significant this increase is depends on an individual 's baseline risk - influenced by factors such as smoking , diet , weight and exercise , the scientists say .	And for people with two copies of the gene the risk rises by up to 70 % from this baseline .	In a second study published in the same journal , the scientists show PIA2 is also linked to an increased risk of heart attacks in people under 45 .	More research is needed to see whether this holds true for the whole population , they say .	About 150,000 people have a stroke in the UK each year and more than 100,000 heart attacks are recorded annually .	Both thrombotic strokes -LRB- the most common kind -RRB- and heart attacks are caused by blockage of blood vessels in the heart and brain - ultimately through the formation of clots .	The faulty gene appears to affect a protein called glycoprotein IIIa - present on platelets , natural clotting cells in the blood .	Platelets help trigger the formation of clots to stop bleeding after injury .	But scientists say carrying the gene may render them overactive .	They caution that overall the genes play a smaller role in risk than more established factors , such as high blood pressure and obesity .	But developing a genetic test could help predict people at highest risk , allowing doctors to suggest more potent medication or lifestyle changes , they say .	Prof Albert Ferro , of King 's College London , who led the research , told the BBC : `` We would now need to validate this test and see how useful it is in the clinical world . ''	Dr Shamim Quadir , of the Stroke Association , said : `` These latest results are an important step forward in stroke research .	`` We hope the findings from this study could lead to many more people who are most at risk of this devastating condition being identified .	`` However , if you have a family history of stroke or have any other risk factors , this does not mean the condition is inevitable .	Regular exercise , eating a balanced diet and stopping smoking can be important steps to significantly reduce your stroke risk . ''	Prof Jeremy Pearson , of the British Heart Foundation , said : `` It is as yet uncertain whether a genetic test to detect a variation in this protein would be beneficial for patients in everyday practice .	`` All patients who are at risk should be monitored to see whether or not lifestyle changes or medication have a positive impact on the more standard major risk factors such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol .

Share this with	Email	Facebook	Twitter	WhatsApp	Linkedin	Copy this link	The genome sequence from a thigh bone found in Siberia shows the first episode of mixing occurred between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago .	The male hunter is one of the earliest modern humans discovered in Eurasia .	The study in Nature journal also supports the finding that our species emerged from Africa some 60,000 years ago , before spreading around the world .	The analysis raises the possibility that the human line first emerged millions of years earlier than current estimates .	The work of Prof Svante Paabo , from the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig , Germany , is rewriting the story of humanity .	Prof Paabo and his colleagues have pioneered methods to extract DNA from ancient human remains and read its genetic code .	From this sequence , the scientist has been able to decipher an increasingly detailed story of modern humans as they spread across the globe .	`` The amazing thing is that we have a good genome of a 45,000-year-old person who was close to the ancestor of all present-day humans outside Africa , '' He told BBC News .	Prof Paabo has analysed DNA from part of a leg bone of a man that lived in Western Siberia around 45,000 years ago .	This is a key moment at the cross roads of the world , when modern humans were on the cusp of an expansion into Europe and Asia .	The key finding was that the man had large , unshuffled chunks of DNA from a now extinct species of human , Neanderthals , who evolved outside of Africa .	`` Our analysis shows that modern humans had already interbred with Neanderthals then , and we can determine when that first happened much more precisely than we could before . ''	Prof Paabo and his team published research in 2010 that showed that all non-African humans today have Neanderthal DNA .	But that genetic material has been broken into much smaller chunks over the generations .	By extrapolating the size of DNA chunks backwards , Prof Paabo and his colleagues were able to calculate when the first interbreeding with Neanderthals occurred .	His study shows that it was between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago .	According to Prof Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London , this early interbreeding might indicate when the ancestors of people living outside of Africa today made their first steps out of the continent in which our species evolved more than 150,000 years ago .	Prof Stringer was among those who believed that the first exit by modern humans from Africa that give rise to people outside of Africa today might have happened earlier , possibly 100,000 years ago .	The evidence from Prof Paabo 's research is persuading him that it was now much later .	`` There is a dispute as to when that ` Out of Africa ' event happened and this fossil helps to look at that .	It is close to the time I think that modern humans exited from Africa and gave rise to the populations in the rest of the world .	I think that exit happened 60,000 years ago , '' he told BBC News .	The new narrative seems to fit in with a recent new , more accurate dating of the arrival of modern humans into Europe by Prof Thomas Higham of Oxford University .	Research published in August showed that this happened 45,000 years ago .	Prof Paabo 's 45,000-year-old man seems to have lived at a point that was both geographically , and in time , a crossroads for humanity .	`` This does seem to mark a watershed where modern humans were pushing the boundaries further and further in their dispersal out of Africa , '' according to Prof Stringer .	Prof Paabo also compared the DNA of the man living 45,000 years ago with those living today .	He found that the man was genetically midway between Europeans and Asians - indicating he lived close to the time before our species separated into different racial groups .	Prof Paabo was also able to estimate the rate at which human DNA has changed or mutated over the millennia .	He found that it was slower than the rate suggested by fossil evidence and similar to what has been observed in families .	`` We have caught evolution red-handed ! ''	he said gleefully .	This raises the possibility that the very first species of the human line separated from apes 10 or 11 million years ago - rather than the five or six million years ago that genetic evidence had previously suggested .	But he stressed in his research paper that much more analysis was needed before re-dating the emergence of the human line .	`` We caution that -LRB- mutation -RRB- rates may have changed over time and may differ between human populations , '' he said .

Some fire brigades have warned the public could be left `` vulnerable '' and small fires may not be attended .	Fire Minister Penny Mordaunt said fire and rescue authorities have `` robust '' plans in place for the weekend .	Union officials say that under the government 's proposals firefighters will have to work until they are 60 instead of 55 , pay more into their pensions and get less in retirement .	The proposals will leave firefighters at risk of dismissal as their fitness declines into their 50s , the FBU said .	FBU members went on strike in England and Wales in August over the same dispute .	Strike action due to take place in Wales has been averted after a `` significant '' change of direction by the Welsh government , the FBU said .	General secretary Matt Wrack accused the Westminster government of `` sickening hypocrisy '' .	`` The real scandal is that their own pensions are by far the most generous anywhere in the public sector , '' he said .	One firefighter and his son carved pumpkins together and tweeted a photo in support of the strike .	`` It 's an issue which affects both me and my family and I have explained the dispute to him , '' said the firefighter , who asked not to be named .	The West Yorkshire brigade said the public would be left in a `` vulnerable position '' and asked people to take extra care this weekend .	The London brigade said it may not attend rubbish or small grass fires or help anyone stuck in a lift .	Industrial action over the past 18 months has seen fire authorities spend millions hiring contractors to cover for striking FBU members .	The FBU said it expected about 36,000 firefighters to walk out .	The fire minister said : `` All fire and rescue authorities have robust and well-tested plans in place that include back-up support if needed .	`` Public safety is the primary focus and if anyone needs emergency assistance , they should dial 999 . ''	She said strike action was `` unnecessary '' after pension regulations laid in parliament on Tuesday mean nearly three quarters of firefighters will see no change in their pension age in 2015 .

The report was published by the Older People 's Commissioner for Wales .	The Welsh government said it was already taking action on issues raised in the report , A Place to Call Home ?	Care Forum Wales , which represents 500 care providers , said the findings support what it has long been saying .	Experts in health and social care undertook unannounced visits to 100 care homes across Wales .	And more than 2,000 questionnaires were completed by care home residents and their families .	The report 's key conclusion was : `` Too many older people living in care homes quickly become institutionalised .	Their personal identity and individuality rapidly diminishes and they have a lack of choice and control over their lives . ''	It looked at residents ' social participation , their home environment , diet , staffing and training as well as commissioning , regulation and inspection of services .	Commissioner Sarah Rochira called `` for action to deliver the change required within our care homes and ensure that quality of life sits at the heart of the delivery of residential and nursing care across Wales '' .	She said : `` While my review found excellent examples of truly person-centred care , enabling and empowering care that delivers the very best outcomes for older people , there are significant variations across Wales that result in too many older people living in care homes having an unacceptable quality of life . ''	The review was undertaken using the commissioner 's statutory powers which means care providers and public bodies have to act on the findings .	Care and Social Services Inspectorate Wales -LRB- CSSIW -RRB- chief inspector Imelda Richardson said it had moved away from a tick box culture to focusing on quality of life of people during its inspections of older people 's care homes in Wales .	She said while the majority of care homes provide good or excellent care , there is `` still an unacceptable level of care in some homes '' .	Care Forum Wales chair Mario Kreft said the report did not `` fully recognise what is being achieved despite the system '' .	He supported a call for services being commissioned for quality rather than reinforcing a `` culture of compliance to the bare minimum '' .	He added : `` The commissioning process should be about quality and securing value for money and not about paying the lowest possible price . ''	A Welsh government spokesperson said : `` The Welsh government , for its part , is already taking action on many of the areas highlighted in this report through a draft Bill to strengthen the regulation and inspection of social services .	`` We expect the care sector to consider this report carefully - as the Welsh government will - and reply to the Older People 's Commissioner 's specific points .

`` Stalled , '' she said , before challenging anyone in the room to name a significant change that had taken place in the last two years .	So is she right ?	Has the much vaunted Burmese reform project ground to a halt ?	The answer depends on how narrowly you define reform .	When she speaks , Ms Suu Kyi is thinking politics .	The pace of political change has certainly slowed .	In part that 's because the easiest reforms took place in the first 18 months of Thein Sein 's presidency .	In the Burmese context , `` easy '' means decisions that do n't upset the army .	Political prisoners were released , censorship of newspapers and the internet lifted and a -LRB- flawed -RRB- law passed allowing public demonstrations .	In a short period of time , one of the world 's most tightly controlled societies opened up in a way few had thought possible .	Stories critical of ministers were suddenly on the front page of private newspapers , and demonstrations , mostly connected to land rights , have become almost daily events .	But the early pace of those changes has n't been sustained .	There was no way it could .	So did the reformers run out of steam ?	Did Thein Sein 's project reach a roadblock manned by hardliners in the Burmese army ?	Or perhaps we 're close to the final destination - that is , with sanctions lifted and the army still really in charge .	Ms Suu Kyi 's main frustration is that the constitution remains unchanged .	Drafted in 2008 , it entrenches the military 's control of political life , guaranteeing it a quarter of the seats in the Hluttaw -LRB- the Burmese parliament -RRB- , and a veto over any changes to the constitution .	This is what its architects proudly call a `` disciplined democracy '' .	The opposition have focused on the two parts they want changed most .	They are : the clause barring anyone who has foreign family members from becoming president , which effectively prevents Ms Suu Kyi from taking power -LRB- because of her British sons -RRB- and Article 436 , which gives the army a veto on constitutional changes .	Much of Ms Suu Kyi 's annoyance stems from the fact that the legislature that she joined in 2012 , and thus legitimised , is now being cynically used to thwart her ambition .	Just as it would in mature democracies , responsibility for shaping the constitutional reform process was handed to a series of parliamentary committees .	With each committee mirroring the composition of the military-dominated Hluttaw , they 've deliberated for months and delivered entirely predictable results .	Altering the `` Suu Kyi clause '' has been dismissed outright -LRB- as a threat to national sovereignty -RRB- , while amending Article 436 will be discussed in parliament , though if the army remains opposed there 's no way it can be changed .	Ms Suu Kyi 's slim hopes of taking the top job after the election in 2015 now rest on a backroom deal among senior leaders .	Looming in many minds is the possibility of a constitutional crisis this time next year .	What if the party that wins the most seats is unable or unwilling to nominate a president ?	Though the changes that Aung San Suu Kyi wants most have stalled , that 's not to say there have n't been other important developments .	It 's just that they do n't directly involve Ms Suu Kyi .	Ever since independence in 1948 , Myanmar has never been truly at peace , with minority ethnic groups fighting guerrilla wars against the Burman-dominated state .	The last three years has seen real progress towards what would be an unprecedented nationwide ceasefire agreement .	All the major rebel groups have been brought into the process , attracted by the promise of dialogue on a more federal future .	For President Thein Sein , a peace agreement would be the crowning achievement of what 's likely to be his only term in office .	Unfortunately for him , with a deal within reach , the number of clashes has begun to increase once more .	Outside politics , particularly in the big cities , people 's lives are changing fast .	Thanks to new laws and regulations , Myanmar 's economy and banking sectors are liberalising and opening up to the outside world .	GDP growth is rapid , though improvements in living standards still lag a long way behind .	On Myanmar 's streets two new foreign phone companies are currently battling it out for a lucrative new market .	After years in which mobile phones and the internet were government-run and SIM cards the preserve of the elite , there 's now the prospect of low-cost data and unrestricted access to information .	In itself that 's a game-changer .	So is the Myanmar reform glass half full or half empty ?	It rather depends who you are , and what you 're drinking .

The Fire Department of New York earlier told the BBC the two people were uninjured and tethered .	The call came in at 12:42 EST -LRB- 17:42 GMT -RRB- and firefighters were on the scene in less than four minutes , it said .	The window cleaners were pulled inside at around 14:15 EST. .	The rescued men were identified as Juan Lopez , who has been a window cleaner for five years , and Juan Lizama , who has been on the job for 14 years , Gerard McEneaney , a labour union official , told Reuters .	The 1,776 ft -LRB- 541m -RRB- tower opened for business last week as the first of 3,000 employees of publishing giant Conde Nast moved into their new offices there .	A police official said the partially collapsed cradle was hanging at `` a 75-degree angle '' .	The cable on the cradle apparently broke as it retracted towards the roof of the building .	People on the ground were moved back in case glass fell from One World Trade Center , the country 's tallest skyscraper .	Gary Hansen , an architect who worked on the building , happened to be across the street during the incident .	Mr Hansen told Reuters the building was designed with three cranes on top , two to suspend platforms and one for emergencies .	`` These are the kind of emergencies architects plan for , '' he said .
The band 's set at Seaclose Park will be their only festival show of the year .	The set on Sunday 14 June , which will close the festival , will include original member Christine McVie , who recently confirmed that she would be rejoining the band .	Festival organiser John Giddings told Newsbeat : `` It 's the best news I 've had in a long while . ''	He said that he had been asking the band to perform at the Isle of Wight for the last seven years .	`` Every year I have asked without fail , '' he revealed .	`` I 'd like to tell you otherwise but it 's true , I have begged them . ''	Previous acts to headline Isle of Wight Festival include The Who , the Rolling Stones and Paul McCartney .	Despite his years of asking the band to perform , John Giddings explained that he thought Fleetwood Mac , whose debut album Peter Green 's Fleetwood Mac went to number four in the UK in 1968 , did n't need much persuading .	He said : `` If you 're a band of substance , it -LSB- Isle of Wight -RSB- becomes part of your bucket list really . ''	Red Hot Chili Peppers , Kings of Leon and Biffy Clyro headlined the event this year .	Talking about choosing the rest of the 2015 line-up , John Giddings said : `` The problem is when you 're looking for some of the top acts in the world , there are n't that many of that calibre ... without repeating yourself it becomes harder by the year . ''	However , the organiser did say there would be some newer acts named on the line-up .	`` When we announce Friday and Saturday , you will see younger bands .	It 's an eclectic mix of past , present and future bands . ''	The organiser added that the other two headline acts of the festival would be announced soon .	Giddings agreed younger bands have the ability to sell festival tickets as well as older bands like Fleetwood Mac and Lionel Ritchie , who has been named as the first act on the Glastonbury 2015 line-up .	He said : `` I think younger bands of course can do it as well , but the golden age of rock and roll is past .	`` The music is different now whereby you can download individual songs on iTunes and it becomes hard to name the lead singer of Bastille or Imagine Dragons . ''	He said `` there are lots of groups out there '' but added `` who is the biggest act out of England that have toured stadiums in the last five years ?	One Direction .	`` I think they 'd rather be somewhere else than at the Isle of Wight festival . ''	However , John Giddings did say `` there are great new bands out there '' and referred to The Black Keys and Royal Blood as `` incredible '' .	The Isle of Wight organiser was recently quoted as calling Ed Sheeran `` boring '' having suggested `` we 're -LRB- the UK -RRB- not building headliners any more '' .	He told Newsbeat that `` he 's jolly good fun '' and after saying he 'd recently met the 23-year-old added : `` He 's selling tickets and he 's selling records and we should all be grateful for his existence .

The shadow attorney general has written to the Australian Federal Police -LRB- AFP -RRB- seeking an immediate investigation .	The HRC released a report condemning the treatment of children in detention .	Their report said that detaining children of asylum seekers violated international human rights law , and called for their release .	Speaking to journalists in Sydney on Wednesday , Mr Abbott repeated his earlier statements that the government had lost confidence in Ms Triggs as president of the HRC .	`` What she does is a matter for her , '' said Mr Abbott in response to a question about whether she should resign .	`` As the secretary of the Attorney General 's Department has made clear , she was not asked to resign and no inducement has been offered . ''	On Tuesday , Australia 's Prime Minister Tony Abbott launched a scathing attack on the HRC report , saying that it was a `` political stitch-up '' .	Earlier in a senate hearing , Ms Triggs said that she had been asked to resign during a meeting on 3 February by the secretary of Attorney General George Brandis ' department .	`` I rejected it out of hand , '' she said , as quoted by ABC News .	Ms Triggs told the hearing that the department 's secretary , Chris Moraitis , had said that she would be offered another job with the government .	She added that she had been `` very shaken and shocked '' by the `` disgraceful proposal '' and had reminded Mr Moraitis that she had a five-year statutory position .	In a letter to the AFP commissioner , Shadow Attorney General Mark Dreyfus said : `` The attorney general 's offer to an independent statutory officer of an inducement to resign her position as president , with the object of affecting the leadership of the -LSB- HRC -RSB- to avoid political damage to the Abbott government may constitute corrupt and unlawful conduct . ''	ABC News reported that Mr Dreyfus said that Ms Triggs preferred not to use the term `` inducement '' but that she had made it clear that the resignation request and the offer of a job had been connected .	Local media reported that Mr Moraitis has denied asking Ms Triggs to resign but said they had discussed the possibility of her taking on another role .	The attorney general admitted to the senate committee that he had lost confidence in Ms Triggs because of the timing of the inquiry into detained children , according to local media .	He added that `` as a matter of goodwill '' he had told Mr Moraitis that he hoped that she could be encouraged to serve the government in other capacities .	The HRC report , entitled The Forgotten Children , was published earlier in February .	It said a third of detained children had developed mental illnesses of such severity that they required psychiatric treatment .	The number of children in detention has fallen under Mr Abbott 's government .	He has questioned why the HRC did not launch an inquiry when the Labor government was in power and there were almost 2,000 children in detention centres .	Successive Australian governments have been criticised over their harsh asylum policies , under which asylum seekers are detained for long periods in offshore camps while their applications are processed .
The French government proposed senior diplomat Laurent Stefanini for the post in January but the Vatican is yet to respond to approve the choice .	The Vatican usually responds within six weeks to approve such a new ambassador .	The nomination of Mr Stefanini was seen as a litmus test for Pope Francis , who has taken a more liberal stance on homosexuality .	A French government spokesman said there had been negotiations with the Vatican over the appointment .	`` France has chosen its ambassador to the Vatican .	This choice was Stefanini and that remains the French proposal , '' said spokesman Stephane Le Foll .	Observers say most Vatican appointments are confirmed within six weeks and that this long silence should be read as a rejection .	The Vatican traditionally makes no statement if it intends to decline a nomination .	Mr Stefanini served in the Holy See as a deputy ambassador in the French embassy from 2001 to 2005 .	He was described by the country 's foreign ministry as `` one of our best diplomats '' .	France legalised same-sex marriage in 2013 , despite opposition from the Catholic Church .	Pope Francis is regarded as more tolerant of homosexuality than previous popes .	`` Who am I to judge ? ''	, he said in 2013 .
What were initially thought to be just a couple of brilliant , closely spaced features at one location now turn out to be a clutch of many smaller dots .	The latest pictures were acquired by the US space agency 's Dawn spacecraft on its first full science orbit since arriving at Ceres on 6 March .	The spots were seen from a distance of 13,600 km .	Researchers on the mission concede they still have much to learn about the dots ' true nature , but the new data is hardening their ideas .	`` Dawn scientists can now conclude that the intense brightness of these spots is due to the reflection of sunlight by highly reflective material on the surface , possibly ice , '' said Chris Russell , who is the principal investigator on the mission .	With a diameter of 950km , Ceres is the largest object in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter .	Dawn will spend the coming months studying its geology and surface chemistry with a suite of cameras and remote-sensing instruments .	The intention is to get some insights into the processes that have sculpted the dwarf since its formation with the rest of the Solar System some 4.5 billion years year ago .	Having completed its first science orbit , Dawn is now heading downwards to get even closer to the body .	This second mapping campaign , which will commence on 6 June , will see Dawn moving just 4,400 km from the surface .	Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter : @BBCAmos
The local authority has awarded the sum to Hearthstone Investments , a London property fund which hopes to build 1,000 new homes across the country .	The Falkirk Local Government Pension Scheme Fund contribution could pay for up to 300 new homes , including 126 in Falkirk and Clackmannanshire .	Social Justice secretary Alex Neil said the fund was `` a trailblazer '' .	Hearthstone aims to raise # 150m for its Housing Fund For Scotland , including contributions from the country 's 11 local government pension schemes .	It plans to provide funds to local housing associations to invest directly in social housing , as well as buying affordable homes to be let at a mid-market rent .	Edinburgh-based housing association Castle Rock Edinvar will manage the initial building programme for social rent houses .	Mr Neil said : `` The # 30m Falkirk Local Government Pension Scheme fund investment will , I believe , act as a trailblazer and encourage other Scottish local authority pension fund trustees to take the plunge and invest in housing .	`` For an acceptable risk profile , investment will provide pension funds good , long-term returns for their members and a social investment to help build stronger communities .

The train was carrying a flammable , toxic substance called acrylonitrile when it came off the rails near Maryville , just outside Knoxville .	Firefighters evacuated people within a two-mile radius of the fire to prevent them breathing in the poisonous fumes .	Local police said seven officers were hospitalised because of the fumes .	The train was pulling 57 carriages of mixed freight from Ohio to Georgia when it derailed just before midnight on Wednesday , the train 's operators CSX said in a statement .	One of the carriages transporting acrylonitrile burst into flames .	Acrylonitrile is a chemical compound used to manufacture plastics .	Officials say it is `` highly flammable and toxic '' and can cause headaches , nausea and kidney irritation if inhaled .	Firefighters wearing breathing equipment went door-to-door telling Maryville residents to move to temporary shelters , one of which has been set up in a high school out of the at-risk area .	Locals have been told the evacuation could last up to 48 hours .
Rural Affairs Secretary Richard Lochhead announced the move earlier this month .	Almost 30 organisations have signed an open letter seeking an urgent meeting with him to discuss their concerns .	Mr Lochhead said the changes would not affect research .	Under EU rules , GM crops must be formally authorised before they can be cultivated .	An amendment came into force earlier this year , allowing member states and devolved administrations to restrict or ban the cultivation of genetically modified organisms within their territory .	Mr Lochhead announced he would use the amendment to request Scotland be excluded from European consents for the cultivation of GM crops .	The letter - whose signatories include the National Farmers ' Union , the Royal Society of Edinburgh , the Roslin Institute and the European Academies Science Advisory Council - said they were `` extremely concerned '' about the `` negative impact '' a ban could have .	It claimed the decision was `` political and not based on any informed scientific assessment of risk '' .	The scientists and academics said outlawing the cultivation of GM crops `` risks constraining Scotland 's contribution to research and leaving Scotland without access to agricultural innovations which are making farming more sustainable elsewhere in the world . ''	The letter cited examples where `` a GM method has a contribution to make '' .	It highlighted ongoing research on things which `` might benefit Scotland 's farmers , consumers and environment '' including potatoes that can reduce fungicide use and omega-3 enriched oilseeds that may offer a more sustainable source of feed for salmon farming .	Responding to the letter , Mr Lochhead said he respected the views of those in the scientific community and would be happy to meet them .	He said he would `` reassure them that these changes will not affect research as it is currently carried out in Scotland , where the contained use of GM plants is permitted for scientific purposes , such as in laboratories or sealed glasshouse facilities '' .	He added : `` However , just because GM crops can be cultivated in Scotland it does n't mean they should be .	`` Scotland 's Â # 14bn food sector has a reputation for a clean and green image across the world and allowing the cultivation of GM crops could damage that unique selling point . ''	Last week , a former chief science adviser to the Scottish government warned on ban on GM crops could have `` apocalyptic '' consequences and threaten the country 's food and drinks industry .	Prof Muffy Calder , who stepped down from the role in December and has yet to be replaced , said she was `` disappointed and angry '' and called on ministers to publish the scientific basis for their decision .	Professor Neva Haites , vice president for life sciences at The Royal Society of Edinburgh , told BBC Scotland : `` Most governments try to get the best advice possible before they make these decisions .	`` In the past we have had chief scientific advisers such as Dame Anne Glover and Prof Calder , who were there to give advice on such subjects .	`` We no longer have such an adviser in government at the moment and the scientific body that usually gives advice has not met for some time .	`` So we are suggesting it is time they actually looked again and sought some very senior advice on this subject . ''
Carlos Ghosn , Renault 's chairman and chief executive officer , also hinted the company 's relationship with Red Bull is likely to end this year .	Ghosn said : `` We have already alerted the F1 authorities and told them : ` Do n't count on us as a provider of an engine - it 's over . ' ''	Renault is in the process of trying to negotiate a takeover of the cash-strapped Lotus team .	But Ghosn said there was still a possibility the company could walk away from F1 .	`` Our future is the subject of detailed analysis and renegotiating , '' he said .	`` We will either exit or run our own team .	We do n't have a clear decision yet . ''	Renault has an engine supply contract with Red Bull until 2016 .	But Red Bull are doing `` necessary due diligence '' in talking to other engine suppliers , with the team expected to use Ferrari power next year after failing to come to an agreement with Mercedes .	Ghosn said Renault would `` honour our contracts '' but admitted the company was renegotiating `` so it 's too early to say what 's going to be the conclusion '' .	Ghosn said Red Bull 's treatment of Renault during the previous six years had been instrumental in the company 's decision .	The pairing won four consecutive drivers ' and constructors ' world titles from 2010-13 , but Red Bull have been heavily critical of Renault in public since the start of 2014 .	The Austrian team accuse the French manufacturer of failing to build a competitive version of the new turbo hybrid engines that F1 adopted last year .	`` Unfortunately when we were winning championships the Renault name was never mentioned .	It was the team that was winning , '' he said .	`` So we started to feel the return on this investment was very weak .	`` It was intensified by the fact that when the technology changed and we moved from the V8 engine to the present technology , some of the teams using our engine did not fare well , and the reasons for which they are not performing became the engine .	`` So you are in the game that when you perform very well you are never mentioned , and when there is a problem with the team you are the first guy to be pointed at . ''	Ghosn said it was not a question of whether the criticism was `` fair or unfair '' .	He added : `` It 's a sport .	You ca n't just say ' I lost , but my team-mate was really ... '	`` I think it 's a question of sportsmanship .	We are expecting , that when we are in a sport working with other people , we win together and we lose together . ''
The Richmond Park and North Kingston MP said he was `` honoured '' after winning 70 % of the 9,227 votes cast using an online primary system .	He beat London Assembly Member Andrew Boff , MEP Syed Kamall and London 's deputy mayor for crime and policing Stephen Greenhalgh .	Mr Goldsmith 's main rival is likely to be Labour 's Sadiq Khan .	Mr Khan beat former cabinet minister Tessa Jowell and a number of other current MPs to win the Labour nomination last month .	Caroline Pidgeon is the Lib Dem candidate , Sian Berry will contest the election for the Greens and UKIP has chosen its culture spokesman Peter Whittle .	Former Respect MP George Galloway is also running .	Mr Goldsmith , who was the favourite for the Tory nomination , balloted his constituents earlier this year to seek permission to stand .	At the very point of his entry into the race for London mayor , Zac Goldsmith 's decision revealed two big characteristics .	Only a politician with an acute sense of accountability would have sought permission to stand through a ballot of his constituency members in Richmond and North Kingston .	Only someone with his personal wealth would have been able to afford the estimated Â # 60,000 cost of doing it .	Both characteristics could come to feature heavily in the months to come .	Read the whole article	He won Friday 's vote comfortably , getting 6,514 votes , more than the other three candidates combined .	Syed Kamall came second with 1,477 votes ahead of Stephen Greenhalgh -LRB- 864 -RRB- and Andrew Boff -LRB- 372 -RRB- .	Mr Goldsmith - who first entered Parliament in 2010 - told the BBC 's Daily Politics that he hoped his environmental record would appeal to Green and Lib Dem voters and he also hoped to `` reach out '' to UKIP supporters frustrated with politics as usual and the UK 's relationship with the EU .	Mr Goldsmith , who has confirmed he would stand down from Parliament if he became mayor , triggering a by-election , said he wanted to build on current mayor Boris Johnson 's achievements .	But he said anyone who attempted to replicate Mr Johnson 's style of leadership would be `` deluded '' as he was a `` unique figure '' in British politics .	`` If people are in the market for a ` Boris mark two ' are going to be very disappointed , '' he said , adding that people wanted someone who `` will bend George Osborne 's ear and get a good deal for London '' .	He also told the BBC News Channel that high-polluting vehicles should be `` phased out '' of the capital 's streets and that his biggest priority would be housing .	Both Mr Khan and Mr Goldsmith oppose a new runway at Heathrow airport , a fact described by the British Chambers of Commerce as `` depressing '' .	Mr Goldsmith is also promising more transport investment to prevent London `` grinding to a halt '' and to `` protect , enhance and improve access '' to green spaces .	Current mayor Boris Johnson will step down next year after two terms in office .	He is also currently the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip , having been returned to Parliament in May .	Some Conservatives have called for an inquiry into the mayoral election process after only 9,227 people voted - compared with a 87,884 turnout for the Labour contest .	In an attempt to open up the contest to people who were n't Conservative members , anyone on the electoral roll was able register to vote for Â # 1 .	But one of the campaign teams told the BBC earlier this month the process `` looked chaotic '' .	Speaking on the BBC 's Daily Politics , Mr Galloway dismissed Mr Goldsmith as a `` Great Gatsby figure '' who could not relate to most Londoners ' lives and Mr Khan as `` a very boring man '' .	He revealed policies including compulsorily purchasing any house left vacant for more than a year and having 50 % of all homes in the capital as social housing .
The 68-year-old Dutchman was appointed in March , when the Black Cats were one point above the relegation zone .	He guided them to safety and was due to leave the club in the summer , only to sign a new one-year contract .	Advocaat said : `` I have made the decision to go after only eight games as I felt it was important to give everyone time to turn things around . ''	Sunderland chairman Ellis Short said : `` I am truly saddened by Dick 's decision , but I respect him for his honesty .	Media playback is not supported on this device	`` It is also testament to his character that he has foregone any kind of a financial settlement , something which is very unusual in football . ''	Assistant head coach Zeljko Petrovic has also left the club .	Saturday 's draw with West Ham left Sunderland without a win in their first eight league matches and looking for a sixth manager in four years .	Since Steve Bruce was sacked in November 2011 , Martin O'Neill , Paolo di Canio , Gus Poyet and Advocaat have managed the club .	Advocaat 's departure also follows a trend set by Di Canio and Poyet of managers arriving to save the Black Cats from the drop , only to depart in the next season .	He initially agreed to lead Sunderland only until the end of last season , shedding tears as their survival was secured with a 0-0 draw at Arsenal .	Advocaat said he would leave the club to fulfil a promise to his wife , but changed his mind and returned in June .	The former Netherlands , Russia and South Korea boss has seen his side win just once this season - against League Two Exeter in the League Cup .	North-east rivals Newcastle are the only team below them in the Premier League table .
While it limits recruitment from outside the EU , it has `` stimulated recruitment '' from EU countries , the home affairs select committee said .	Net migration rose by 30 % in the year to June , to 336,000 - more than three times David Cameron 's intended target .	The PM has said he will not abandon his aim to reduce the figure to 100,000 .	Under the immigration cap , introduced in 2011 , the number of `` tier 2 '' visas issued to skilled workers from non-EU countries is limited to 20,700 a year .	But a report by the select committee concluded the limit had been `` counter-productive '' .	It added that `` a large number '' of applications from nurses with job offers in the UK were being rejected because of limits on the number of visas issued each month .	Committee chairman Keith Vaz said the government 's immigration cap was having `` no effect '' on bringing down net migration - the difference between those coming into the country and those going out each year - but `` could have caused a crisis in the NHS this winter '' .	He said : `` When the cap was reached earlier this year , we saw the perverse effects of the system , as the cap prioritises higher-paid jobs .	`` In June , nurses were being prevented from working in the UK , which necessitated the government taking emergency measures to allow recruitment to continue .	`` Whilst this was a very welcome move , it is clear to see that the system could have caused a crisis in the NHS this winter .	`` A system which encourages panicked adjustments to be functional is not fit for purpose .	Nurses should remain on the shortage occupation list . ''	A total of 641,000 people moved to the UK in 2014 , the Office for National Statistics said .
The ska group tweeted the news : `` It is with deep regret that we say goodbye to our great friend , the world 's greatest drummer , our beloved Brad .	RIP . ''	Bradbury joined The Specials in 1979 , and continued with the reversioned band The Special AKA , who had a top 10 hit with Free Nelson Mandela .	Bradbury took part in The Specials reunion tour in 2009 .	He also headed up a band called JB Allstars .	The band 's representatives said the drummer died in England but no cause of death was given .	In a statement , his family said : `` It is with deepest regret that we have to announce the very sad news that our much loved husband and father John ` Brad ' Bradbury passed away on Monday the 28 of December .	`` Brad 's drumming was the powerhouse behind The Specials and it was seen as a key part to the Two Tone sound .	He was much respected in the world of drumming and his style of reggae and ska was seen as genuinely ground-breaking when The Specials first hit the charts in 1979 .	`` He was an integral part of The Specials reforming in 2008 and toured with them extensively up to the present day .	His contribution to the world of music can not be understated and he will much missed by family , friends and fans alike .	`` It is the family 's sincerest wish that they are allowed the time to remember him privately . ''	The news comes three months after the band 's trombonist , Rico Rodriguez , died .	The band , famed for their 1960s mod-style outfits , had seven UK top 10 singles including Too Much Too Young and Ghost Town .	Founder and songwriter Jerry Dammers dissolved the band in 1981 but they re-grouped and continue to perform and record without their former leading man .	Billy Bragg was one of the first musicans to pay tribute to Bradbury. : `` A bad day for good music .	First we lose Lemmy , now news that Brad from the Specials has passed away .	RIP . ''	Bradbury was born and brought up in Coventry where the band was formed in 1977 .	Music producer Pete Waterman , also from Coventry , expressed his shock at the news of the Bradbury 's death .	Speaking to BBC Coventry and Warwickshire , Waterman said : `` I always had a good laugh with Brad .	He was always proud of being in the band and what we 'd and he 'd achieved .	`` He never left Coventry because he always wanted to be part of the scene ... he was tremendous . ''

The copyright has now expired and Munich 's Institute of Contemporary History is to publish a new edition .	New versions are expected in many countries .	Historians say the book helps academics understand what happened in the Nazi era .	Its annotated version , with thousands of academic notes , will aim to show that Mein Kampf -LRB- My Struggle -RRB- is incoherent and badly written , rather than powerful or seductive .	Many Jewish groups have welcomed this particular publication , saying it is important to have access to a critical edition to help explain the Holocaust , reports the BBC 's Damien McGuinness in Berlin .	Mein Kampf was originally printed in 1925 - eight years before Hitler came to power .	After Nazi Germany was defeated in 1945 , the Allied forces handed the copyright to the book to the state of Bavaria .	The local authorities have refused to allow the book to be reprinted to prevent incitement of hatred , although the book was so widely printed during the war that it remained relatively easily available .	Under European copyright law , the rights of an author of a literary or artistic work runs for the life of the author and for 70 years after his death - in Hitler 's case on 30 April 1945 , when he shot himself in his bunker in Berlin .	Those rights cease on the first day of January 70 years after the author 's death , and so publishers now have free access to the original text .	However , German officials have said they will limit public access to the text amid fears that this could stir neo-Nazi sentiment .
West Berkshire Council is setting up an emotional health academy to train psychology graduates and health professionals .	The local authority said , once trained , its staff will work with children , families and schools .	It wants to greatly reduce the wait mental health patients face from 12 months to less than a week .	The council also hopes the new academy will stop problems escalating to the stage where they require attention from more highly trained mental health specialists .	Director of Children 's Services Rachael Wardell said : `` It works better if you get in there sooner , when people are waiting for help their condition gets worse .	`` There are lots more things you can do early on without needing to go to a very high-level with a psychologist or psychiatrist .	`` It is a way of bridging the gap . ''	Plans were submitted to the Department of Health in October and the council hopes to launch the academy in April while contributing about Â # 120,000 a year , with local schools matching its total .	Local NHS commissioning groups could also contribute Â # 100,000 a year and local businesses are being asked to help out financially as well .
The city in western Germany is putting 2,500 police officers on the streets for the week-long event .	Germany was shocked by the New Year assaults , largely blamed on migrants .	More than 100 women were victims , but the full scale only emerged later .	Separately , police have arrested three suspected Islamist militants in raids .	Cologne sex attacks : Women describe ` terrible ' assaults	The raids on flats and offices took place on Thursday in Berlin , Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia .	The two men and one woman detained are among four suspected of links to the so-called Islamic State group .	One of those held was being sought by Algerian authorities , and they may have been planning an attack in Germany , police said .	The New Year unrest in Cologne fuelled German unease about a huge influx of asylum seekers .	Two men - a Tunisian and a Moroccan - have been charged over the Cologne offences .	But in total there were 945 complaints to Cologne police after the New Year trouble , 559 of them allegations of sexual assault .	Thirty-five suspects are being investigated .	German authorities spoke of a new type of crime , in which gangs of drunken men - described as North African - targeted women .	Cologne resident Miriam was attacked as she and a friend made her way home on New Year 's Eve .	She said she was going to the carnival celebrations `` but with really mixed feelings '' .	`` I 'm wondering if something like that could happen again . ''	Miriam 's mother , Jozi , said the incident changed the way she sees migrants .	`` We live in a multicultural area with lots of Moroccans , I 've never had a second thought before - we 're friends , we greet each other , talk to each other .	It was all fine .	But now I 'm looking at it with different eyes . ''	Organisers have not said how many people have attended this year 's carnival , but correspondents say the numbers are much lower than in previous years .	Police will be present at a new `` Security Point '' for women near Cologne Cathedral - the area where most of the assaults took place during New Year celebrations .	Police have been trialling `` body cams '' which can film suspects during incidents .	German authorities have also brought in British face recognition experts to help identify those involve in the attacks on New Year 's Eve .	Known as `` super-recognisers '' , the officers from the London Metropolitan Police can recognise up to 95 % of the faces they have seen - compared to about 20 % for most people .	Migration to Germany from outside the EU soared to a record 1.1 million last year .	The Cologne assaults contributed to a slump in the approval rating of Chancellor Angela Merkel .	She has been criticised by conservative allies , as well as by many opposition politicians , for having welcomed so many asylum seekers to Germany .	The many Syrian and Iraqi refugees generally get asylum , but many economic migrants from outside the EU are also trying to settle in Germany .
The ex-Middlesbrough assistant , who held the same post at Hartlepool under Colin Cooper from 2013 to 2014 , succeeded Ronnie Moore on Wednesday .	Moore parted company with Pools after Tuesday 's 2-1 home defeat by Stevenage .	`` The quality I 've seen in training , the intensity and the tempo took me by surprise a bit , '' Hignett told BBC Tees .	`` I 'm walking into a positive situation .	Results and performances have n't been the same , the group of players I 've seen today are more than capable of beating teams in this league . ''	Former Tranmere and Rotherham boss Moore helped retain Hartlepool 's Football League status last term after his appointment in December 2014 .	However despite a run of four straight wins at the start of the campaign , form tailed off and Hignett will go into Saturday 's home game against Yeovil looking for a first win in five with his side four points above the relegation zone .	`` First and foremost we need to get away from where we are , '' he added .	`` I need to get my message across to the team quickly because there will be a change in style . ''	Liverpudlian Hignett is a self-confessed relaxed and jovial character , but says that will have no impact on his performance with reference to Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp .	`` Tell Jurgen Klopp that -LSB- you have to be serious -RSB- , there 's a time to be serious and a time where you do n't have to be , '' he added .	`` I do like a laugh and a joke , but when I 'm serious I 'm serious , there 's a time and a place .	`` Training we have to be serious , match-day ultra serious , but after the game - win lose or draw - I 'll be me .	`` If I want to have a laugh and joke afterwards , as long as the result is n't too bad then I will . ''	Since Hignett 's last stint on the Pools ' touchline , the club has been taken over by JPNG - led by chairman Gary Coxall - from Ken Hodcroft and IOR Limited .	`` I was really impressed by what he -LSB- Coxall -RSB- had to say , '' Hignett added .	`` What he wants to do with the club in the future , how he wants to grow the club , his vision , he wanted a clear identity for it - everything I 'd want to bring to a football club .	`` For me it was the perfect fit .

It is calling for faster broadband access for homes and business .	A government spokesperson said most UK homes can get `` superfast '' broadband .	`` Almost nine out of ten UK properties has access to superfast speeds and 95 % of the UK will be reached by 2017 , '' a spokesperson for the Department for Culture , Media and Sport told the BBC .	But the IoD believes the target should be higher and is calling for speeds of 10 gigabits per second -LRB- Gbps -RRB- by 2030 , 1,000 times faster than the current official aim of 10 megabits per second -LRB- Mbps -RRB- by 2020 .	`` Now is the time to set a bold new target for genuinely world-beating broadband , '' said Dan Lewis , senior advisor on Infrastructure Policy at the IoD , and author of the report .	`` We have the leading internet economy in the G20 , and yet download speeds are mediocre and the coverage of fibre optic cable is woeful . ''	He added : `` Unfortunately , the Government 's current target displays a distinct poverty of ambition . ''	Mr Lewis said the government needed to look at how the UK could provide the physical infrastructure needed to maintain a position `` at the forefront of digital innovation in business '' .	IoD members interviewed for the report said that better broadband speeds could increase their company 's productivity , make them more competitive , and enable them to offer more flexible working to their staff .	The IoD report comes just days after communications watchdog Ofcom said BT must open up its cable network and allow competition to improve UK internet connections .	Ofcom also said there was a digital divide in the UK between those with the latest technologies , and those without .	It has proposed that decent , affordable broadband should be a universal right .	Rivals had called for a split between BT and its Openreach operation , which runs its cables , fibre and network infrastructure .	Companies such as Sky , Vodafone and TalkTalk , who pay to use the network , had claimed that BT underinvested in Openreach , leading to a poor service with interruptions and slow speeds .

Mr Tsilikin , 54 , was found on Thursday evening after friends and family had been unable to contact him .	His mobile phone and computer are missing .	Police have opened a murder inquiry .	Mr Tsilikin was a well-known culture and arts critic , working on TV and radio as well as for print media such as Kommersant , Vogue and Elle .	Mr Tsilikin had reportedly just returned from a trip to the Latvian capital , Riga .	Friends and family last spoke to him at the end of last week .	Mr Tsilikin was found with multiple knife wounds and it is believed he may have been dead for at least two days .	The Russian Investigative Committee said a forensic investigation was being carried out and it had not ruled out `` murder committed on domestic grounds '' .	St Petersburg Union of Journalists chairwoman Lyudmila Fomichev told Kommersant : `` This is a great tragedy for the entire journalistic community , because he was a very well-known , great journalist who wrote on culture and art .

A 24-hour walkout by members of the Rail , Maritime and Transport -LRB- RMT -RRB- union , in protest at the introduction of driver-only trains , ended at 11:00 BST on Wednesday .	Southern warned passengers to expect `` difficult and frustrating '' journeys throughout the day .	Two further strikes have been announced for 10 May and 12 May .	Latest updates here	The RMT confirmed it would attend talks with Southern `` over the guards jobs and safety dispute '' on Friday .	Dyan Crowther , chief operating officer for Southern owner Govia Thameslink Railway , told BBC Sussex : `` We are very pleased to hear that and we look forward to meeting the RMT '' .	Southern said some routes were again suspended or reduced with 700 fewer services across Sussex and east Surrey .	Ms Crowther said the timetable would not return to normal until Thursday as they needed to get rolling stock and staff into the right position .	Paul Barker , a commuter from Rye , normally catches a Southern train to Ashford then a high-speed service to St Pancras .	He said he worked from home on Tuesday but went to Robertsbridge on Wednesday to catch a Southeastern service to London .	He said : `` It was standing room only from Frant , but you can not take two days off work '' .	RMT general secretary Mick Cash said : `` This dispute is about safety .	The company , with an eye on ever-fatter profits , is prepared to axe the guards on some of the most overcrowded and potentially-dangerous services . ''	The company said there would be no job or pay cuts but the planned changes would make conductors more visible while drivers would operate doors .	It accused the RMT of `` scaremongering '' and said `` driver-only operation is a safe , proven way of working '' which had been used `` on 40 % of trains across the Southern network for 25 years '' .
Amina Ali Nkeki , 19 , was found with a baby by an army-backed vigilante group on Tuesday in the huge Sambisa Forest , close to the border with Cameroon .	She was one of 219 pupils missing since they were abducted from a secondary school in eastern Chibok in April 2014 .	They were taken by the Islamist militant group Boko Haram .	Amina was reportedly recognised by a civilian fighter of the Civilian Joint Task Force -LRB- JTF -RRB- , a vigilante group set up to help fight Boko Haram .	She was with a suspected Boko Haram fighter who is now in the Nigerian military 's custody .	Named as Mohammed Hayatu , he said he was Amina 's husband .	Aboku Gaji , leader of the JTF in Chibok :	`` The moment this girl was discovered by our vigilantes , she was brought to my house .	I instantly recognised her , and insisted we should take her to her parents .	`` When we arrived at the house ... I asked the mother to come and identify someone .	The moment she saw her , she shouted her name : ` Amina , Amina ! '	She gave her the biggest hug ever , as if they were going to roll on the ground , we had to stabilise them .	`` The mother called the attention of other relations to come out and see what is happening .	The girl started comforting the mother , saying : ` Please Mum , take it easy , relax .	I never thought I would ever see you again , wipe your tears .	God has made it possible for us to see each other again . '	`` Afterwards , we had to make them understand that the girl would not be left in their care .	She must be handed over to the authority . ''	Interview with BBC Hausa service	Amina and her baby have been taken to taken to the regional capital Maiduguri for medical attention , the military said .	A spokesman for Nigeria 's President Muhammadu Buhari said the rescued young woman would be brought to meet the head of state , before being helped to reintegrate into society .	Chibok rescue revives Twitter campaign	Inside Mbalala , the town that lost its girls	Chibok abductions : What we know	Hosea Abana Tsambido , the chairman of the Chibok community in the capital , Abuja , told the BBC that Amina had been found after venturing into the forest to search for firewood .	`` She was sayingâ $ ¦ all the Chibok girls are still there in the Sambisa except six of them that have already died . ''	By Will Ross , BBC News	Amina was found by a local vigilante group out on a routine patrol .	These groups , which have played a vital role in the fight against Boko Haram , sprang up in 2013 in the main city of north-east Nigeria , Maiduguri .	It was a desperate measure at a terrible time when the jihadists were winning the war , seizing territory whilst reports of soldiers fleeing rather than fighting were common .	More vigilante groups then sprang up across the north-east and , with local knowledge of the terrain , they had some success stopping their homes from being taken over - even though they were armed with just rudimentary weapons .	As the Nigerian military started getting its act together at the beginning of 2015 , with help from outside , it started retaking territory and in some areas worked effectively with the vigilantes .	There is , however , great concern that as peace returns the vigilantes - who have tasted power - pose a danger themselves .	During the April 2014 attack , Boko Haram gunmen arrived in Chibok late at night , then raided the school dormitories and loaded 276 girls on to trucks .	More than 50 managed to escape within hours , mostly by jumping off the lorries and running off into roadside bushes .	A video broadcast by CNN in April this year appeared to show some of the kidnapped schoolgirls alive .	Fifteen girls in black robes were pictured .	They said they were being treated well but wanted to be with their families .	The video was allegedly shot on Christmas Day 2015 and some of the girls were identified by their parents .	The Chibok schoolgirls , many of whom are Christian , had previously not been seen since May 2014 , when Boko Haram released a video of about 130 of them gathered together reciting the Koran .	The abduction led to the #BringBackOurGirls campaign , which was supported by US First Lady Michelle Obama and Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai .	` Boko Haram took my children '	Town divided by Boko Haram legacy	On patrol against Boko Haram	Who are Boko Haram ?

Mansfield voted most strongly to leave , with 70.9 % backing Brexit .	Rushcliffe , which includes the towns of West Bridgford and Bingham , was the only area to vote for Remain .	It saw the East Midland 's highest turnout .	Meanwhile , the turnout in Nottingham was the fifth lowest in the UK at 61.8 % .	Leave won by a tiny margin of just over 2,000 votes in the city .	Mr Mann said his party was `` somewhat out of touch '' .	`` With the middle classes largely voting remain because they see it as benefiting them and the working classes largely voting to leave because it dis-benefits them - that 's the divide in Britain , '' he said .	Latest reaction and updates from Nottinghamshire	Like large parts of England , Nottinghamshire overwhelmingly voted to leave the European Union .	The margin of victory in Bassetlaw , Ashfield and Mansfield was huge , with less than a third of people voting remain .	Arguably the biggest surprise came in Nottingham , which narrowly backed Brexit .	Affluent Rushcliffe was the only area to vote Remain .	Overall Nottinghamshire voted 57.9 % for Leave and 42.1 % for Remain .	Conservative Anna Soubry , the MP for Broxtowe and a Remain campaigner , tweeted it was `` a dreadful decision '' .	`` People like me were told you 're scaremongering , we do n't want to listen to the experts , '' she said .	`` All that has been unfortunately proved to be accurate .	We have made a very , very , very bad mistake . ''	Labour MP for Nottingham North , Graham Allen , said David Cameron had `` gambled with Britain 's future '' by calling for a referendum , saying people voted to leave `` in protest '' at the current government .	Turnout was 81.5 % in Rushcliffe - the highest in the East Midlands and the only council area to vote Remain .	The vote was close elsewhere , including in Nottingham , where the split was 50.8 % Leave , 49.2 % Remain .	Alice , a caller to BBC Radio Nottingham from the Carrington area of the city , said she felt `` frightened of the future '' .	`` It potentially gives a mandate for a lot of prejudice against people who have immigrated here , whether from the EU or elsewhere , '' she said .

But a palace spokesman denied that there is any official plan for the monarch to abdicate in what would be an unprecedented move in modern Japan .	Crown Prince Naruhito , 56 , is next in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne .	An unnamed government source told Japan 's Kyodo news agency that the emperor , who plays a largely ceremonial role but is respected deeply by many Japanese , has been contemplating the move for about a year .	His family had accepted his decision , an unnamed palace source told NHK .	However , both palace and government sources say the Imperial Household Law would have to revised to allow for the abdication to take place .	A change to the Imperial Household Law , which stipulates the rules of succession , would require approval by Japan 's parliament .	Despite a categorical denial of the reports by imperial palace spokesman Shinichiro Yamamoto , the emperor 's reported wishes are being given prominent attention in the Japanese media .	Emperor Akihito has been admired for distancing the monarchy from its association with the aggressive nationalism of World War Two .	In 1989 he succeeded his father , Hirohito , who had had the status of a living god in Japan until he was stripped of that role by the victorious Americans who wrote the country 's post-war constitution .

She said economic growth and a stronger jobs market meant `` the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened in recent months '' .	There has been a growing expectation that US interest rates will rise this year .	Some economists are saying that the next hike could even come next month .	The central bank raised interest rates at the end of last year for the first time in nearly a decade , but has held them steady amid concerns over persistently low inflation .	Ms Yellen , speaking at a three-day symposium in Jackson Hole , Wyoming , did not comment on when rates would rise .	But she said `` the US economy was nearing the Federal Reserve 's statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability '' .	She added : `` In light of the continued solid performance of the labour market and our outlook for economic activity and inflation , I believe the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened in recent months . ''	However , Ms Yellen emphasised that future rate increases should be `` gradual '' .	She noted that inflation is still running below the Fed 's 2 % target , but said this is being depressed mainly by temporary factors .	Subadra Rajappa , head of rates strategy at Societe Generale , in Washington , said : `` We were n't really expecting her to signal a hike at the September meeting , but she 's just kept the door open for a hike sooner rather than later .	`` I think that the Fed wants to get the market to start pricing in a hike for this year , which they were n't doing earlier , and now I 'm seeing the probability of a hike by December has gone up slightly over a coin toss . ''	John Canally , economist at Boston-based LPL Financial , added : `` It looks like she is warming a little more to a hike this year , probably not September but probably December . ''	Signs of slow improvements in the US economy came in data published on Friday .	Although the growth rate of second quarter GDP was revised down slightly , from an annual rate of 1.2 % to 1.1 % , consumer spending - which makes up more than two-thirds of US economic activity - was revised up from 4.2 % to 4.4 % .	Separately , US Labor Department figures showed that claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 261,000 for the week ended 20 August .	It was the third straight weekly decline in claims .	On Tuesday , Commerce Department data showed that US new homes sales jumped in July to their fastest rate in nearly nine years .

They are planning to stage a protest on Friday night .	However , a community advert placed in the Irish News said the protest would not help ease tensions .	Among the signatories are politicians , academics and sporting organisations as well as the Catholic Bishop of Down and Connor , Noel Treanor , and the Church of Ireland Bishop of Connor , Alan Abernethy .	It stated : `` We believe this is the best opportunity we have had in 15 years to resolve an issue , which has divided our community for many years .	`` It is our view the introduction of another evening parade , no matter what part of the community it comes from , would inevitably and regrettably , whether intentional or otherwise raise tensions , damage community relations , and has the potential to end in confrontation and undermine a long sought after resolution . ''	The agreement to which Garc is opposed was announced last week between the Orange Order and the Crumlin Ardoyne Residents Association -LRB- Cara -RRB- .	The group is billing its protest as a `` march and rally to oppose ongoing sectarian parades and SF/UVF deal -LRB- Sinn FÃ © in/Ulster Volunteer Force -RRB- . ''	The SDLP has not added its name to the advert .	However , in a statement SDLP North Belfast MLA Nichola Mallon said : `` There are genuine frustrations and fears in this community as the weekend approaches .	`` However , it is also important that people express their views and feelings in a responsible manner .	`` Our advice to Garc is to reconsider their planned parade this Friday , to take a step back and act in the interests of peace in our community . ''	The Parades Commission has granted permission for Garc to hold their parade on Friday evening subject to a number of conditions - including directing it away from `` part of the notified route between Ardoyne Road or Crumlin Road '' .	Permission has also been granted for Garc to hold a protest parade on Saturday morning .	Garc spokesperson Damien ` Dee ' Fennell attended the launch of dissident republican party Saoradh on Saturday 24 September , and Garc has been consistently highly critical of Sinn FÃ © in .

MPs Holly Lynch and Conor McGinn have resigned , it was confirmed .	Ms Lynch tweeted it was `` time to focus '' on her marginal constituency while Mr McGinn said it was the `` right time '' to concentrate on his seat and his family .	A spokesman for Mr Corbyn thanked them for their service and said that their positions would be filled `` in due course '' .	As his reshuffle continued , Mr Corbyn said 10 MPs who left the front bench in a mass walkout over the summer were returning .	They are Jack Dromey , Pat Glass , Sharon Hodgson , Roberta Blackman-Woods , Kevin Brennan , Louise Haigh , Jenny Chapman , Matthew Pennycook , Nick Thomas-Symonds and Emma Lewell-Buck .	Mr Corbyn said : `` I am pleased to announce the appointment of 21 MPs to our front bench , 14 of whom are women and four of whom are from the black and minority ethnic community .	`` I welcome back the 10 who have returned , and look forward to working with the eight talented MPs joining the front bench for the first time .

The ministerial response shows 5 % of council schools have budget deficits .	Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said funding gaps had become a `` national scandal '' .	`` Over 1,000 schools are in the red .	This should be worrying to every parent , '' said Mr Farron .	His party had asked ministers how many schools and academy trusts , which run chains of schools , were in debt .	There have been growing warnings from schools about problems with funding .	The heads of every state school in West Sussex recently sent a letter to Downing Street , warning that they would have to consider cutting school hours or making teachers redundant if they did not receive emergency funding .	They warned that schools faced a `` dire financial position '' .	In a debate this week on school funding in West Sussex , MPs backed their concerns .	Sir Nicholas Soames , Conservative MP for Mid-Sussex , said funding arrangements were `` unsatisfactory and unfair '' and budget shortages would have a `` damaging effect '' on schools .	Tim Loughton , Conservative MP for East Worthing , said there was `` nothing left in the tank '' for many schools and that head teachers were telling him that school finances were at `` breaking point '' .	Head teachers say that budgets have not kept up with rising costs .	There are also particular regional shortfalls , with the government postponing plans to introduce a national funding formula aimed at addressing local anomalies in funding levels .	Education Minister Nick Gibb 's reply to the question on schools in debt showed that in 2014-15 there were 113 academy trusts with a revenue deficit , representing 4 % of trusts .	There were 944 local authority schools in deficit , representing 5.3 % of such schools .	The National Association of Head Teachers said problems with school funding were `` very serious '' .	A spokesman said a survey showed that two-thirds of schools were `` dipping into reserves to stave off deficits '' - and there were fears that rising costs would make this worse .	`` I worry that in order for schools to bring their budgets in line to repay their debt , they will have to look at cutting staff , which makes up for 80 % of the school expenditure , '' said Mr Farron .	`` There will be less extracurricular activities , IT equipment or even books as cash is funnelled into clearing the debt . ''	Kevin Courtney , general secretary of the National Union of Teachers , called on the government to provide `` immediate additional funding '' .	`` School budgets are being cut to the bone , and many more could find themselves in debt as the funding crisis worsens .	`` We estimate that 92 % of schools in England could face real terms budget cuts over the next four years . ''	But Department for Education spokeswoman said : `` All academy trusts must balance their budget from each academic financial year to the next .	`` We continue to monitor the tiny number of trusts which reported a deficit at the end of the academic year 2014-15 .

The ruling was quashed after an appeal .	The UK Supreme Court has now been asked to overturn the decision .	There were widespread loyalist protests across Northern Ireland after Belfast City Council decided not to fly the Union flag at the City Hall every day of the year in December 2012 .	The protests included a weekly parade between east Belfast and City Hall , which passed the nationalist Short Strand area .	Critics accused the police of being too soft as some of the protests descended into violence .	The PSNI insisted it did not have the legal powers to stop them , and warned that doing so might have made the situation worse .	In April 2014 , a judge in the High Court in Belfast upheld a claim by a Short Strand resident , who can not be named to protect his safety , that the PSNI had failed in its legal duty to stop the parades .	The judge said the police had not understood the full scope of their powers and had facilitated illegal and sometimes violent parades , in breach of their legal duties .	That ruling was appealed by then Chief Constable Matt Baggott , and quashed by the Court of Appeal .	The legal battle moved to the UK Supreme Court in London on Tuesday .	A lawyer representing the unnamed resident , told five judges the PSNI had failed in its duty to enforce the law as set out in the Public Processions Northern Ireland Act -LRB- 1998 -RRB- .	She argued that the Court of Appeal had no grounds to interfere and overturn the original trial decision as `` the evidence before the court was unimpeachable '' .	The lawyer said there were `` evident flaws '' in the Court of Appeal decision and its analysis of the evidence .	Lord Neuberger , President of the Supreme Court , asked her : `` So you say that we should go back to the trial judge and , provided we concluded that there was evidence on which he could fairly reach the decision that he did , that we should reinstate his decision ? ''	She replied : `` Yes . ''	But a lawyer representing the PSNI said the Court of Appeal had made the correct decision .	He said the context of the time the protests had taken place was important .	He told the court the police had been dealing with a series of sporadic unplanned protests at more than 80 locations across Northern Ireland .	He insisted there had been `` no error of law '' and that the police fully understood that they could have stopped the parades , but took an operational decision not to so .	He said the police believed that `` robust action '' could have made the situation worse and took a deliberate decision to secure evidence of offences committed and to prosecute offenders afterwards .	The lawyer referred to research by Queen 's University , which recorded that 306 people had been convicted of flag-protest-related offences across Northern Ireland in the months after the protests .	`` Many would have considered the police approach to policing these parades was successful , and that their policy of de-escalation succeeded , '' he said .	The judges said they would announce their decision `` in due course '' .

On the first anniversary of Storm Desmond , experts say November to January were the wettest three months since UK records began in 1910 .	Review author Terry Marsh said flooding was `` extensive and repetitive '' .	Storm Desmond began battering parts of the UK on 5 December , depositing a record month 's worth of rain on Cumbria in just one day .	About 5,200 homes were flooded in Cumbria and Lancashire , while tens of thousands more lost power after an electricity sub-station in Lancaster was flooded .	The storm caused an estimated insurance bill of more than Â # 1.3 bn .	Major storms `` Abigail '' , `` Frank '' and `` Gertrude '' also hit the UK last winter .	A study by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology -LRB- CEH -RRB- , in collaboration with the British Hydrological Society , found many rivers across northern England , Scotland and Northern Ireland saw record peak flows during the three-month period .	It found the rivers Eden , Tyne and Lune in England saw record peaks of around 1,700 cubic metres per second .	Experts say such levels could fill London 's Royal Albert Hall in less than a minute .	Although last winter 's floods were more extreme in scale , flooding in 1947 had a greater impact in terms of homes flooded and crops destroyed , the appraisal found .	However , lead author Terry Marsh from CEH said the national scale of last winter 's floods were `` the most extreme on record '' .	`` The associated flooding was both extensive and repetitive , and total river outflows from Great Britain following the passage of Storm Desmond in December exceeded the previous maximum by a substantial margin , '' he said .

The findings were published on Tuesday by Statistics Canada .	The annual report by the federal statistics agency was compiled using police data from across the country .	Nearly half of all incidents were linked to race or ethnicity , with black Canadians the most common target .	Just over a third of reported hate crimes were motivated by hatred of a religion .	Canada 's Jewish population remained the most targeted religious group , accounting for 13 % of all incidents , despite a decline in the overall number of reported crimes .	Shimon Koffler Fogel , with the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs , called the data `` disturbing and clear '' .	He also said in the statement that the Jewish community stood with other targeted groups in condemning hatred in all its forms .	`` An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us , '' he said .	Muslims reported being more frequently targeted in 2015 , with 159 incidents reported compared with 99 in 2014 , accounting for 12 % of all incidents .	However , Statistics Canada notes many police services have reached out to ethnic communities and there have been efforts by groups like the National Council of Canadian Muslims -LRB- NCCM -RRB- to encourage reporting .	Incidents targeting Catholics also increased , jumping from 35 to 55 individual incidents .	Almost 40 % of all reported hate crimes were considered violent incidents , which could include assault and uttering threats .	Members of the LGBT community reported slightly fewer hate crimes in 2015 but were more likely to be the victims of hate-related violence .	In a news conference following the report 's release , the NCCM 's legal counsel , Khalid Elgazzar , pointed to the murder of six men in a Quebec City mosque this January as `` a painful reminder of how hate can destroy lives and deeply shake communities '' .	The NCCM was joined by other groups in calling for more funding and resources for police forces to fight hate crimes and improve reporting .	The Statistics Canada report notes that the figures do not paint a full picture of the true extent of hate crime in Canada .	They suggest that only about 35 % of hate crimes are actually reported to police .

The Duchess of Cambridge joined the princes on the garden tour .	A spokeswoman for Kensington Palace said : `` The engagement will allow the princes to pay tribute to the life and work of their mother . ''	They met representatives from the causes and charities supported by Diana , including the Royal Marsden and Great Ormond Street hospitals , the National Aids Trust , Centrepoint youth homelessness charity and the Leprosy Mission .	Members of the public have been leaving tributes and flowers at the gates of the palace to mark the anniversary of Diana 's death .	The Princess of Wales died on 31 August 1997 in Paris , when William , now the Duke of Cambridge , was 15 and his brother was 12 .	The garden at their mother 's former home has been inspired by memories of her life , style and image , such as her white `` Elvis '' Catherine Walker dress .	The White Garden , as it is known , follows a tradition first established at Sissinghurst Castle in Kent , famous for its own white garden created in the 1930s .	Their Royal Highnesses met gardener Sean Harkin who designed the display and Graham Dillamore who knew the princess when he worked there some 30 years ago .	The garden has been open since spring and will continue into September with white roses , lilies , gladioli and cosmos .	It is the fourth London memorial created in tribute to Diana - the others are the Diana Memorial Playground at Kensington Palace , the Diana Memorial Fountain in Hyde Park , and the Diana Memorial Walk at St James 's Palace .
