U.S. and European officials suspect that Iran 's civilian nuclear energy program masks an effort to obtain technology that could be used in the production of an atomic bomb. U.S. and European officials may impose a 4th round of sanctions on Tehran when the U.N. Security Council considers the issue of Iran 's nuclear energy program most likely in September 2007. The International Atomic Energy Agency distributed limited copies of the IAEA report before a meeting on 11 September 2007 of the 35 members of the IAEA board. The findings reflect an agency agreement on 21 August 2007 with Tehran that Iranian officials began publicizing the week of 12 August 2007. The accord said that there were no remaining issues and ambiguities regarding Iran 's nuclear program and activities. According to an account by Reuters news agency the IAEA report said the work plan is a significant step forward. Reuters quoted a senior U.N. official as stating the Iranian government 's efforts to enrich uranium had slowed. The IAEA report stated that Iranian officials must continue to build confidence about the scope and nature of Iran 's present and future nuclear program. Iranian officials on 30 August 2007 stated cooperation with the IAEA possibly to prevent a further round of international sanctions. Iran 's representative to the IAEA Ali Asghar SOLTANIEH stated to Tehran 's Fars news agency that the report emphasized that there exists no sign or evidence indicating diversion of Iran 's nuclear activities and that all of Iran 's nuclear materials have been audited. Some Nonproliferation Experts stated the IAEA was ceding too much to Iran. Arms control experts David Albright and Jacqueline Shire of the Washington based Institute for Science and International Security wrote in a criticism published the week of 19 August 2007 that the idea of closing files violates fundamental safeguards principles and that the agreement does not specify that Iranian officials would provide the IAEA access to key people facilities and documents that are needed to verify Iranian answers to the IAEA 's questions. Independent experts stated Iran 's latest agreement with the IAEA which gives inspectors access to more nuclear sites and information falls short of the West 's demand to halt the production of concentrated uranium that could potentially be used for a bomb. U.S. State Department spokesman for the Bush administration Tom Casey stated that while the report may offer some new details or insight into the development of Iran 's program Iranian officials have not met any international obligations regarding the nuclear program. Casey stated the fact that the nuclear program continues to move forward shows that the Iranian regime is continuing on a path of defiance of the international community. Most Western Nonproliferation Experts stated the Agreement on 21 August 2007 contained little that could dissuade policymakers in Washington London Paris and Berlin from moving forward with another round of Security Council sanctions. Experts stated many of the transparency issues reportedly resolved in the Agreement on 21 August 2007 should have been resolved previously. Executive Director of nonpartisan Washington think tank the Arms Control Association Daryl G. Kimball stated the agreement does not address the problem that the Iranian government is pursuing an enrichment technology and capability that could lead to the production of nuclear bomb material. Kimball stated the Iranian government 's design is to deflect criticism and pressure and to claim that progress is being made. Iranian officials stated a possible reduction in collaboration with inspectors in the event of more sanctions. The Security Council has voted unanimously to impose sanctions against Iran but the penalties have been limited from U.S. demands under Chinese and Russian pressure. SOLTANIEH stated in an interview with state controlled Iranian television that the report and the measures taken make the intervention of any other international organization including the Security Council irrelevant and unjustified.
