Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill stated on 18 June 2007 that the North Korean government may be prepared to begin shutting down a plutonium producing reactor in June 2007 as the first step toward disabling the Unit by December 2007. Hill is the head American negotiator on North Korea 's nuclear weapons program. Hill stated stalled efforts to dismantle North Korea 's nuclear weapons program could move ahead after the weekend of 16 June 2007 and 17 June 2007 when Pyongyang officials invited inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency to visit for talks on verifying and monitoring a shutdown. Following talks with Chinese negotiator Wu Dawei Hill stated the shutdown has long been anticipated. Hill stated the shutdown could occur in a matter of weeks not months. The Associated Press reported from Vienna Austria that the IAEA stated on 18 June 2007 that a team would visit Pyongyang the week of 24 June 2007 to discuss the manner in which inspectors will verify the shutdown. Hill stated IAEA inspectors will hold talks with Pyongyang officials on sealing the reactor which would include the installation of television monitors at the site. North Korean officials refused to proceed with a February 2007 agreement to begin decommissioning the Yongbyon reactor until funds worth 25 million dollars in accounts linked to North Korea held in a Macao Bank were transferred to North Korea. The money was frozen when officials from the United States accused the Banco Delta Asia of complicity in financial crimes on behalf of North Korea. The funds were wired on 14 June 2007 to the New York Federal Reserve Bank after months of disagreement over the method of returning the funds. The funds were to be sent to Russia 's Central Bank before a transfer to an account controlled by the North Korea government in a Russian commercial bank. Hill stated talks will occur the week of 17 June 2007 with disarmament negotiators from Russia South Korea and Japan on steps to recoup some of the time lost while the financial transfer was being organized. The discussions will also involve setting a timetable for resumption of 6 nation arms control talks. Under the agreement reached in February 2007 North Korean officials pledged to shut down the Yongbyon reactor and allow inspectors to verify and monitor the shutdown in return for a 50000 ton shipment of fuel oil. North Korean officials will declare all nuclear programs and disable all facilities in return for a further 950000 tons of fuel oil in the next phase of the Agreement. Hill stated the technical possibility of concluding the next phase of the agreement by December 2007.
