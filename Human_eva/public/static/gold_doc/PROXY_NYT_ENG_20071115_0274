A list from the Nuclear Suppliers Group shows that Iran has been denied purchases of nuclear related materials approximately 75 times since 1998 because of suspicions the purchases could have been used for building bombs. The 45 nation Nuclear Suppliers Group is an offshoot of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and is charged with monitoring international trade to ensure that nuclear technology transferred for peaceful purposes is not directed to military use. The Nuclear Suppliers Group is composed of technologically advanced countries. According to the Nuclear Suppliers Group 's mission statement countries act on an individual basis to block trades that violate export controls devised to maintain international cooperation on peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The Nuclear Suppliers Group has no enforcement power beyond notifying companies of violating the group 's guidelines. The Nuclear Suppliers Group keeps data private and meets largely in secret. Most of the denials of purchase have occurred since 2002 and have resulted from interventions by members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. The list of trade denials was made available by a diplomat from a country interested in exposing the extent of Iranian efforts to acquire so called dual use items that can be converted to weapons production. The list was made available on condition that neither the diplomat nor the diplomat 's country be identified. The list names companies from Australia Finland Sweden the United Arab Emirates and Iran that were prevented from carrying out deals because the items being sold were suspected of being militarily useful. The listed items being offered for sale in the blocked deals included Nickel powder petrochemical plant components compressors furnaces steel flanges and fittings electron microscopes radiometric ore sorting machines valves and tubing lasers a rotary drilling rig a mass spectrometer and a nitrogen production plant. The Iranian end users included the Government of Iran and Iran 's Atomic Energy Organization power companies engineering petrochemical and oil refining and gas companies aircraft industries schools universities engine manufacturers mineral research centers a helicopter support company and a plasma physics center. The diplomat stated the 75 denials represented actions by only 7 of the 45 member States. The diplomat stated the actual number of denials of sales of dual use products to Iran is probably much higher than 75. Western diplomats stated that the government in Tehran uses front companies to receive and convert technology to weapons production without being detected as the standoff with Iran over Iran 's nuclear program has continued. Iran is a signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty but not a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.
