The official website of Iraq 's Shiite religious leader the Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani was defaced and blocked in a sectarian motivated cyber attack on Shiite related sites. It was not clear whether the attack began on 18 September 2008 or the morning of 19 September 2008. By the evening of 19 September 2008 Al-Sistani 's website was offline. Another website related to 1 of Al-Sistani 's religious organizations www.al-shia.com was also affected. An alternative address www.sistani.com was still operational. Iranian News Agency Fars stated that group XP had blocked access to approximately 300 Shiite related sites on 18 September 2008 and 19 September 2008. Neither the hacking claim nor an Iranian assertion that group XP was based in the United Arab Emirates could be verified independently. Several Iranian news sites stated on 19 September 2008 that many of the Shiite and Iran related web sites that had been attacked were running normally again. A statement signed group XP was posted on the home page of Al-Sistani 's web site and stated that the attack was on behalf of Sunni Muslims. The statement said. Group XP had carried out similar attacks on other Shiite sites in the Persian Gulf and Iraq. Group XP erased the site as group XP has done with other Rafidha sites. Rafidha means rejecters and is an insult used by Sunni extremists to describe Shiites. Al-Sistani promoted sexual deviance and an Iranian agenda in Iraq as Al-Sistani was born in Iran. Any website with material that was contrary to Sunni teachings would be punished. The statement also consisted of a youtube video clip of American comedian bill Maher ridiculing a fatwa by Al-Sistani on whether certain positions of sexual intercourse were permitted for married couples. The ayatollah 's office in Najaf declined to comment on the cyber attack. Fars reported that a counterattack had been carried out against 2 major Wahhabi web sites which belong to puritanical strain of Sunni Islam that is dominant in Saudi Arabia.
