Head of the U.N. drug office Antonio Maria Costa said that Afghanistan has produced so much opium in recent years that the Taliban are cutting back poppy cultivation and stockpiling raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve a major source of financing for the insurgency. Costa said this to reporters last week as the U.N. Drug Office Office prepared to release its latest survey of Afghanistan 's opium crop. The survey showed that poppy cultivation had retreated in much of Afghanistan and was overwhelmingly concentrated in 7 of 34 provinces where the insurgency remains strong most of those in the south. The survey was issued November 27 2008. The United Nations found that the result was a 19 percent reduction in the amount of land devoted to opium in Afghanistan even though the total tonnage of opium produced dropped by just 6 percent. The study stated that the high output per acre was attributed to a good growing season in the south. The southern region is a heavily irrigated area where the Taliban maintained a strong presence in 5 provinces and have systematically encouraged opium cultivation as a way to finance their insurgency for several years. The U.N. estimates the insurgents made as much as 300 million dollars from the opium trade last year. Costa said a lot of war effort can be funded with 2 to 300 million dollars. The Taliban have producing an amount of opium that far exceeds world demand due to 3 successive years of bumper crops. Costa said the result was a glut that was depressing the price which dropped by approximately 20 percent. Costa said that the fact that prices had not collapsed already was evidence that the Taliban drug lords and even some farmers have stockpiled the opium. An increasing amount is also being processed in Afghanistan. Costa added that insurgents have been holding significant amounts of opium. Costa said the surplus is as much as 11000 tons or more than twice world demand in the last 3 years and threatened to devalue their stockpiles. The United Nations found that Afghanistan produced 8500 tons of opium in 2008. World demand was estimated at about 4400 tons per year. The Taliban this year are taking a passive stance toward cultivation and putting less pressure on Afghan farmers to plant opium poppy. This then supports the current price. Costa is an Italian diplomat who has served at the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime for 6 years.
