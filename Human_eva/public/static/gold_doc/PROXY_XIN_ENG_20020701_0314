On 1 July 2002 former Peruvian spy chief during the government of ex president Alberto Fujimori Vladimiro Montesinos was convicted of illegally taking control of the National Intelligence Service when Montesinos was supposed to be only an adviser to the spy agency. Montesinos was sentenced to 9 years and 4 months in prison for abuse of authority. The sentence also ordered Montesinos pay a fine of 3 million dollars as compensation to the State. Anti corruption judge Saul Pena stated Montesinos has admitted to the abuse of authority charge. This is the first ruling of more than 50 charges against Montesinos which include corruption drug trafficking illegal arms deals and human rights violations. Montesinos is alleged to run a network of bribes. A leaked videotape showed Montesinos bribing a congressman to switch to the government party and triggered events that culminated in Fujimori 's resignation in November 2000. Fujimori is accused of dereliction of duty and embezzlement and has been in self imposed exile in Japan since resigning to avoid the legal action from the Peruvian authorities under the protection of dual nationality. Montesinos fled Peru in October 2000 but was captured in Venezuela on 23 June 2001. Montesinos heard the sentence at the Callao Naval Base where Montesinos has been imprisoned since 2001. Montesinos stated Montesinos would consult with a defense lawyer to appeal.
