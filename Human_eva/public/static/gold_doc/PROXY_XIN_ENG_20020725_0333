A document signed by a former high ranking officer of the Peruvian army and disclosed on 020725 mentions links with drug trafficking and could further compromise the situation of the former head of the National Intelligence Service of Peru Vladimiro Montesinos. A front page story in Peru 's national daily El Comercio said Montesinos could have authorized the military leadership at Alto Huallaga to deal in drugs so as to find the leaders of the rebel group shinning path and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement. Alto Huallaga is located northeast of the capital Lima. The story is based on the final report of the Attorney General 's office. The Attorney General 's Office report collected an accusatory document handed over by an unnamed Peruvian army general. El Comercio said that in 920000 the government of then president Alberto Fujimori put into effect the intelligence operation Scorpion to fight terrorism and drug trafficking in the Amazon region. As part of the SCORPION plan several agents infiltrated into the groups to gather information on the main rebel and drug trafficking commanders. There also were additional orders for transporting cocaine as a cover for the agents. Montesinos was a close adviser to former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori. Fujimori resigned in 001100 over a bribery scandal and is now imprisoned in Lima for alleged connection with the scandal.
