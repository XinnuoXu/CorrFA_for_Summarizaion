State run Radio Nepal reported on 20 October 2002 that at least 3 policemen were killed and 19 others wounded the evening of 19 October 2002 when their vehicle was ambushed by anti government guerrillas in western Nepal. Radio Nepal quoted a security official as stating. 3 police personnel including an inspector and a sub inspector were killed when 2 police vehicles were moving towards Tikapur area in Kailali district in search of the guerrillas. The policemen killed and wounded were all in the first vehicle. The driver of the vehicle was also killed in the ambush. 5 police personnel are still missing. The wounded police personnel were brought to Kathmandu and Nepalgunj for treatment and additional security personnel were mobilized in the area to defend against the guerrillas. Anti government insurgents have increased their violent activities across the Himalayan kingdom since the 9 month long nationwide state of emergency expired at the end of August 2002. The Nepali government initiated peace talks with the guerrillas in August 2001 in order to find a peaceful solution to the guerrilla insurgency that has killed more than 5000 people including policemen guerrilla members and civilians since it began in the Himalayan kingdom in 1996. The 3 rounds of talks held were inconclusive as the guerrillas demanded the establishment of a republican State an interim government and a new constitution which the Nepali government rejected. More than 3700 guerrillas and hundreds of security personnel have been killed since the Nepali government imposed the state of emergency on 26 November 2001 following a series of attacks by the guerrillas on government security forces after the guerrillas broke 4 month long cease fire talks with the government on 23 November 2001.
