Australian Government is hesitating at using Australian military to intercept the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea DPRK 's vessels suspected of trafficking weapons or drugs. Australian Prime Minister John Howard was quoted on 9 July 2003 by the Australian Associated Press as stating that the Australian government is not at this stage considering military contributions. Howard stated the Australian government is considering ways and means of dealing with a very big problem and the Australian Government must choose descriptors and words sensibly because the Australian government is dealing with a volatile issue and a country that is not operating according to Convention. Howard referenced future talks with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and South Korean President Roh Woo hyun on the issue when Howard visits the region during the week of 14 July 2003. American government has recently formed a proliferation security initiative that consists of 11 members. The Proliferation Security Initiative started a meeting 9 July 2003 in Brisbane. Members of the Proliferation Security Initiative are considering ways of intercepting ships or aircraft suspected of carrying weapons of mass destruction. The American government has reportedly suggested the Australian military could be involved in stopping nations from transporting weapons both on the high seas and through Australian territorial waters.
