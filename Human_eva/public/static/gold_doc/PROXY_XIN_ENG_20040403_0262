On 040403 visiting French President Jacques Chirac became the first Western leader to visit the top secret Russian Titov test and control space center. Chirac flew into Krasnoznamernsk for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the space center. Putin and Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov greeted Chirac at the space center some 40 km southwest of Moscow in Krasnoznamernsk. The closed Soviet era military facility was founded in 570000 and collects and analyzes all information gathered from Russia 's military spy satellites. The space center is also involved in launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles and is working on a plan to develop defensive early warning systems. Putin held two hour meeting with Chirac. Russian Space Forces Commander Lt. Gen. Vladimir Popovkin reported to Chirac and Putin and said it is one of Russia 's priorities to expand space cooperation with France. France is a leader in the European Space Agency. Chirac 's visit has come while the Russian Government has displayed uneasiness about NATO 's latest expansion to the Russian borders and the European Union 's imminent enlargement within the former Soviet sphere of influence in Eastern Europe. At the press conference following the meeting Putin said that Russia 's activities in defending national security are non aggressive and not targeted against anyone. The Titov space center is a military facility and is run by Russian space forces and operates under tight security. Putin said Chirac 's visit there indicated that Russia is developing the most advanced systems of weapons but finds it possible to acquaint its French partners with these projects. Putin stressed that this points to Russia 's transparency and openness in security matters.
